Data on landholdings of rural households are available from NSS
surveys on Land and Livestock Holdings and from Agricultural Censuses.
Limited data on ownership and operational holding of land are also
available on other NSS surveys (for example, NSS Surveys on Consumer
Expenditure and NSS Surveys on Employment and Unemployment).

Rawal(2013) <a class='org-ref-reference' href="#nssland2013">nssland2013</a> on data from NSS Surveys on Land and
Livestock holdings:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Surveys of Land and Livestock Holdings are conducted by NSSO once in
ten years. In these surveys, detailed information is collected on
various aspects of land and livestock holdings. These include
collection of plot-wise data on land use and on tenurial status. There
are two limitations of Land and Livestock Surveys. First, these
surveys are conducted only once in ten years. The last survey was
conducted in 2002-03 and nothing more recent is available. Secondly,
these surveys collect data on all types of land, including homestead
lands, and published NSSO reports do not distinguish between these.
<a class='org-ref-reference' href="#meadcain1983">meadcain1983</a> and <a class='org-ref-reference' href="#epwland2008">epwland2008</a> Have pointed out that this
creates enormous confusion in estimation of extent of landlessness and
inequality in land distribution. <a class='org-ref-reference' href="#meadcain1983">meadcain1983</a> pointed out that,
&ldquo;change and ambiguity in important concepts and definitions and
inconsistency and incompleteness in published tabulations prevent
confident estimation of the percentage of landless households at
different points in time. Far from being able to discern the rate of
change in landlessness, we find that the direction of change remains
uncertain.&rdquo; Availability of household-level data from the 48th round
survey made it possible to separate different types of land. However,
only two rounds of surveys have been conducted since then. Also,
<a class='org-ref-reference' href="#epwland2008">epwland2008</a> has pointed out that the data from these two rounds
are not strictly comparable because of a change in the way data on
cultivation on homestead lands were recorded.

<h2 id="org3453820">Data from NSSO Surveys on Employment and Unemployment/Consumer Expenditure</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3453820">
<p>
Extracts from Rawal(2013) <a class='org-ref-reference' href="#nssland2013">nssland2013</a> on these data:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
There are three items of data in Schedule 10 (on Employment and
Unemployment) and Schedule 01 (on Consumer Expenditure) surveys
pertaining to landholdings. These pertain to:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Land owned by the household,</li>
<li>Land possessed by the household, and</li>
<li>Land cultivated by households.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Conceptually, data on land owned correspond to ownership holding of
land and data on land possessed correspond to operational holding of
land. However, in the NSSO surveys, these items deal with not just
agricultural land but with all types of land, including homestead
land. Aggregation of physical extent of plots of land that are very
dissimilar in terms of their use, their productive potential and their
market value makes these variables unusable.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, data on land cultivated pertain to agricultural
land only, and corresponds to net sown area. Strictly speaking, land
cultivated is different from operational holding of land as it does
not include land that is left fallow.
</p>

<p>
There are three important limitations of this dataset.
</p>

<p>
First, like all sources of data on landholdings, there is a
considerable under-reporting of land by households, in particular, by
households that own large amounts of land. An implication of
under-reporting of land, particularly by large landowners and by
lessors of land, is that the estimates of total land cultivated from
the NSSO surveys of employment and unemployment account for only about
70 per cent of net sown area at the national level.
</p>

<p>
In the context of under-reporting of land, it may also be noted that,
since the extent of under-reporting is supposed to be large for large
landholdings, these data are likely to under-estimate inequality in
ownership and operational holding of land.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, like all official sources on landholdings in India, the NSSO
surveys on employment and unemployment also capture very little
incidence of tenancy. Given that most States of India have legislation
under which leasing of agricultural land is prohibited or regulated,
most tenancy contracts in rural India are informal and oral. Incidence
of such tenancy is concealed and does not appear either in official
records or in official surveys. This problem affects NSSO surveys just
as it affects all other sources of data on land.
</p>

<p>
An inconspicuous but important change has been introduced since
2004-05 in questions pertaining to land in Schedule 1.0 and Schedule
10 of NSSO surveys. Until the 1999-2000 survey, the NSSO schedules
were designed to record the information on extent of land up to two
decimal places. As a result, the smallest land holding recorded was
0.01 hectares. Any household having land less than 0.01 hectares was
treated as landless. In all tabulations in NSSO reports also, the
smallest land size was 0.01 hectares and households having less than
0.01 hectares were treated as landless. In the 61st round (for
2004-05), a small but important change was introduced in the NSSO
schedules. From the 61st round onwards, the Schedule 1.0 and Schedule
10.0 started recording data pertaining to land owned, land possessed
and land cultivated up to three decimal places. As a result, the
smallest size of holding recorded became 0.001 hectares.
Correspondingly, from 2004-05, NSSO reports started to classify
households having land between 0.001 hectares and 0.01 hectares also
as owning/possessing/cultivating land, and only households having less
than 0.001 hectares of land as landless households.
</p>

<p>
This change resulted in a huge drop in proportion of landless
households in the estimates based on these surveys. The effect was
particularly significant in estimates of landlessness in terms of
ownership or possession of land because these variables included
homestead land. As a result of this change, households having only
tiny amounts of homestead land got classified as landowning
households. This change resulted in lowering the proportion of
households that did not own any land by about 20 percentage points and
the proportion of households that did not possess land by about 23
percentage points in each of the rounds since 2004-05.
</p>

<p>
Unless accounted for, this change makes data from surveys prior to
61st round incomparable with data from 61st round survey and
thereafter.

<li>Agricultural Censuses are conducted as part of the <a href="http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-wca/it/">World Censuses of Agriculture</a> coordinated by the <a href="http://www.fao.org">Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations</a> However, unlike the World Agricultural Censuses,
Indian Agricultural Census &ldquo;does not include those holdings which
are not operating any agricultural land and are engaged exclusively
in livestock, poultry and fishing etc.<a href="http://agcensus.nic.in/ACI3.html">(Source)</a> As a result,
Agricultural Censuses in India do not give an data on landlessness
even in terms of access to operational holdings.</li>

<li>In a majority of States, agricultural censuses are based on
retabulation of land records. Land records are not only plagued by
<i>benami</i> registrations but are also often not updated when ownership
of land is transferred because of sale, inheritance or
partitioning. <a class='org-ref-reference' href="#nssland2013">nssland2013</a></li>

<li>Land records are usually individual-based and do not identify a
household. In the survey manuals for Agricultural Censuses,
individual holding is defined at the level of the household: &ldquo;An
individual holding may be operated by one person alone or jointly by
a group of persons but the basic condition is that these persons
must belong to the same household, i.e., they must be residing
together and taking their food from a common kitchen.<a href="http://agcensus.nic.in/report/ac_lr_200506.pdf">(Source)</a>&rdquo;
However, the schedule for data collection for Agricultural Censues
is designed to record a single individual as an &ldquo;operational
holder&rdquo;. There is no clearly stated method that is adopted to
transform this individual owner/cultivator-level information into
household-level information, if this is done at all. The
village-level field officer is asked the verify details about actual
<i>de-facto</i> status on the basis of &ldquo;personal knowledge&rdquo;. The
instructions in this respect are vague, non-objective and are
unlikely to have been implemented with any seriousness. It may also
be noted that over the last few decades, village-level field workers
are transferred from one village to another, and may not even have
much &ldquo;personal knowledge&rdquo; about who actually operates each plot of
land in the village (which could easily run into several thousands
of plots in any Indian village).</li>
