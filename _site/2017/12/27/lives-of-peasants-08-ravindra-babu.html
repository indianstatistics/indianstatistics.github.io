<blockquote>
<p>
Ravindra Babu Dhanwa is an adivasi peasant from Palghar, Maharashtra. Ravindra Babu, belonging to the Malhar Koli tribe, is from Ambhai village in Vada Tehsil of Palghar district, Maharashtra. Most of the land they possess is undulating and rock-strewn, and only about 1.5 acres is cultivable. The land is unirrigated and single-cropped. While the family cannot make their ends meet with production on this small amount of land, food they produce on this land is crucial for their food security. They produced not only 12 quintals of paddy for self-consumption, but also a little bit of urad, tur, ragi and bajra. Adivasis like Ravindra Babu have been part of a series of agitations in Palghar to protect their land, and in turn, to protect their livelihoods and food security. This is the struggle that brought him all the way to Delhi to participate in the Kisan Mukti Sansad in November 2017.

<p>
Ravindra Babu, belonging to the Malhar Koli tribe, is from Ambhai
village in Vada Tehsil of Palghar district, Maharashtra. At the time of
the 2011 Census, about 119 households lived in Ambhai. Adivasis
accounted for about 54 per cent of Ambhai&rsquo;s population. As a result of
the decade long agitation for land titles, thirteen households in Ambhai
have been given <i>pattas</i> so far. Of these, nine households got <i>pattas</i>
for about an acre of land each while the remaining for about 0.75 acres
each.
</p>

<p>
Palghar district, which was carved out of Thane district in 2014, has a
long history of adivasi struggles. They make up about 63 per cent of the
population of Palghar. About 55 per cent of the district is covered with
forests. Adivasis in Palghar live under a persistent threat of their
lands being grabbed by land sharks and continue to struggle for legal
titles to the land that they possess and cultivate. Over the last 10
years, several large demonstrations and protests have been organised by
the All India Kisan Sabha in Thane and Palghar districts to pressurise
district administration to give land titles to adivasi peasants. In
November 2015, about 8000 adivasi peasants from two talukas, Vikramgarh
and Vada, came together for a large demonstration to fight for land
titles. They sat on a <i>dharna</i> for six days, cooking meals from small
quantities of grain contributed by adivasi families. The sit-in forced
the district administration to start accepting applications for land
titles under the Forest Rights Act, 2006 (FRA) and about 10 thousand
applications were filed. This demonstration set an example for peasants
all over Maharashtra to fight for their rights. Since only a few
adivasis got the <i>pattas</i> for land, another massive agitation was
launched in Nashik on October 3, 2016. Over 50000 adivasi peasants
battled rain and blocked all roads for 16 hours, forcing the collector
to agree to initiate the process of distribution of land <i>pattas</i> under
the FRA. Although some <i>pattas</i> were given and applications accepted
from many adivasis, the District Collector was transferred after six
months and the new Collector stalled the process.
</p>

<p>
Ravindra Babu Dhanwa lives in Ambhai with his wife, mother, two sons and
one daughter. They possess 8 acres of forest land. Of this, they
received <i>patta</i> for one acre about six years ago. Most of the land they
possess is undulating and rock-strewn, and only about 1.5 acres is
cultivable. The land is unirrigated and single-cropped. Paddy was sown
on one acre of the cultivable land, and the rest was used for pulses,
ragi and bajra. All the grain was used for their own consumption, and
there was no surplus left to use as seed next year or to sell. They only
sold about three quintals of paddy straw for Rs. 430. All cultivation
was done using family labour but, since they did not have bullocks, they
had to hire a tractor to get the land ploughed.
</p>

<p>
The family cannot make their ends meet with production on this small
amount of land, Ravindra Babu, his wife and eldest son do wage labour on
most of the days. They work as agricultural labourers or do earth work,
whatever is available. In Ambhai, the wages for male workers are Rs. 150
per day while women are paid only Rs. 125. Last year, Ravindra Babu and
his son found wage employment for about 100 days in a year while his
wife managed to get work for only about 50 days. Ravindra Babu&rsquo;s wife
also did all the housework and had to regularly spend time collecting
firewood from the forest.
</p>

<p>
It is important to note that, although land possessed by this household
does not provide them adequate income, it is crucial for their food
security. They produced not only 12 quintals of paddy for
self-consumption, but also a little bit of urad, tur, ragi and bajra.
Adivasis like Ravindra Babu have been part of a series of agitations in
Palghar to protect their land, and in turn, to protect their livelihoods
and food security. This is the struggle that brought him all the way to
Delhi to participate in the Kisan Mukti Sansad in November 2017.
