<p>
Shanti is a woman, dalit tenant farmer from Muzzafarpur district in Bihar. Shanti has a Jan Dhan bank account but she has no money to keep in it. Shanti&rsquo;s family owns a small house but has no crop land of their own. For the last two years they have leased 0.17 acres of land for which they have to pay an annual rent of Rs. 3500. They cultivate paddy on this land in the kharif season and, maize and coriander in the rabi season, using a hired pumpset for irrigation. With little income from land, the household survives primarily on the wage income of Shanti and her eldest son.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Shanti is a farmer from Narauli, a village in Mushahari Block of
Muzzafarpur district in Bihar. She is 70 years old and, besides farming,
has to work as agricultural labourer on fields of others. Her husband, a
few years older than her, used to be a rickshaw-puller but is now too
weak to work. Shanti and her husband are both illiterate but Shanti has
learnt to write her name. She has four sons. The eldest son works as a
painter while his wife does the housework and manages cattle. Shanti&rsquo;s
two sons, twins aged 27 years, work as daily labourers in Delhi. The
youngest son, aged 22 years, is currently studying in college. Shanti
has two grand-daughters and two grandsons.
</p>

<p>
Narauli is a large village. As per the 2011 Census, it had 1083
households and a total population of 5157. Muzzafarpur, the nearest
town, is approximately 14 km away. Shanti&rsquo;s family owns a small house
but has no crop land of their own. For the last two years they have
leased 0.17 acres of land for which they have to pay an annual rent of
Rs. 3500. They cultivate paddy on this land in the kharif season and,
maize and coriander in the rabi season, using a hired pumpset for
irrigation.
</p>

<p>
In the last rabi season (Nov 2016 to April 2017), the land produced six
quintals of maize, of which two quintals were kept for self-consumption
and the rest was sold to the village merchant. They also got 40 kg of
coriander leaves, plucked from time to time and sold in the village
itself at an average rate of Rs. 10 per kg. The family bought farm yard
manure, DAP and urea in small quantities for their land. They bought
maize seeds for Rs. 700. Over the whole season, they irrigated the land
18 times, spending a total of Rs. 1980 on the pump set and diesel. All
the work on this tiny landholding was done using family labour and no
workers were hired. Despite saving the labour costs, they could barely
recover paid out expenses in the rabi season. While they made a tiny
profit of Rs. 1145 from maize, they suffered a loss of Rs.700 from
coriander cultivation.
</p>

<p>
In June 2017, they started preparing the land for paddy cultivation. For
Rs. 300 they hired a tractor for land preparation. They bought seeds for
Rs. 500, and manure and urea for Rs. 900. In the early part of the
season, they needed to water the fields twice, for which they spent Rs. 220. All this expenditure went in vain as the crop was destroyed by
floods soon after. They received no compensation from government, or
from any insurance agency, for the crop loss. In all, they did not
recover even the paid out expenditure in paddy and they incurred a loss
of Rs. 3670. The loss is much greater if one values the family labour
that went into paddy cultivation.
</p>

<p>
Looking at their farm accounts for the whole year, we find that the
family incurred losses in agriculture. The household has primarily
survived on the wage income of Shanti and her eldest son working in
Muzzafarpur. Shanti works as an agricultural worker and gets Rs. 110 for
each day that she finds work.
</p>

<p>
Given their very low incomes, the family had to borrow Rs. 15,000 in
October 2016 from an informal savings group at an interest rate of 2 per
cent per month. Although the family has repaid Rs. 5000 over the last
year, but accounting for the accumulated interest, they still have an
outstanding debt of about Rs. 13500.
</p>

<p>
During demonetisation last year, the family had no notes to deposit.
Shanti has a Jan Dhan bank account but she has no money to keep in it.
They had no access to new notes until March, 2017 and had to buy
everything on credit. The local shopkeeper gave them food items and
other consumables on credit. The family had to visit a doctor during
that time and even the doctor&rsquo;s fee had to be paid later. Shanti managed
to clear these debts only when her sons sent some money from Delhi.
