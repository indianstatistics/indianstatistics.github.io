This note points to a new problem in the methodology of classification
of rural labour households, which was revised as part of the 68th
round of NSSO. This problem has arisen on account of changes in the
method that is used to convert the information on income shares into a
scheme for classification of households. Instead of correcting the way
agricultural labour households and rural labour households were
identified prior to the 68th round, NSSO has created new categories of
households that are not only incomparable with the categories of
agricultural labour households and rural labour households in earlier
surveys, but have serious conceptual problems.

<div id="outline-container-org285a1a1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org285a1a1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
This note deals with the definition of agricultural labour and rural
labour households in the quinquennial rounds of National Sample
Surveys of Consumer Expenditure and of Employment and Unemployment in
India. Identification of rural labour households and agricultural
labour households in the NSSO Surveys of Consumer Expenditure and of
Employment and Unemployment is important because, since 1977-78, data
for these households are used for the quinquennial Rural Labour
Enquiry reports published by the Labour Bureau. Rural Labour Enquiry
reports, the most important official source of statistics on
agricultural and rural workers in India, deal with consumer
expenditure, days of employment, wages and earnings, and indebtedness
among rural labour and agricultural labour households. Data on
consumer expenditure for these households are also used for
determining the weighting diagram used in calculation of the Consumer
Price Indices for Agricultural Labour (CPIAL) and for Rural Labour
(CPIRL).<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Problems in identification of rural labour households have been
discussed in the literature, most recently, in Dhar
(2013)\cite{nsdras2013}.  NSSO Surveys of Consumer Expenditure, and of
Employment and Unemployment, identify different types of households on
the basis of primary source of net household income.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> Dhar
(2013)\cite{nsdras2013} points out that income criterion has been used
to identify agricultural/rural labour households since the second
Agricultural Labour Enquiry, conducted in 1956-57. Dhar
(2013)\cite{nsdras2013} further points out that NSSO does not use any
clearly specified statistical method to obtain either the absolute
levels of income of households or the shares of income from various
sources in order to assign households to specific occupational
categories. Instead, the method of classification of households relies
on the &ldquo;perceptions of the enumerator and respondent&rdquo; regarding
contribution of different activities to income of the household.
</p>

<p>
Investigators are required to somehow ascertain contribution of
different occupations to <i>net</i> income of the household, and then, on
the basis of a specified method, classify the household into different
categories. Instruction manuals for the surveys do not provide
specific questions that the investigators are supposed to ask to get
information on contribution of different sources to net income of
households. It is implicit in the instructions that somehow the
respondents will be able to tell the investigators either the actual
levels of income from different sources, or, at least, the share of
income coming from different sources.
</p>

<p>
Such an assumption is likely to result in gross inaccuracies in
categorisation of households. Dhar (2013)\cite{nsdras2013} argues that
classification based on &ldquo;self-perception&rdquo; may result in
under-estimating the number of rural labour households as some of
these households may report themselves as self-employed.
</p>

<p>
Most casual workers, peasants and households engaged in own-account
household enterprises do not maintain any accounts, and, given
low-levels of education among these sections of the population, are
not even capable of maintaining rigorous, consistent accounts.
Expecting respondent from such households to report <i>net</i> income from
different sources is unrealistic. Any rigorous estimation of household
income, or contribution of different activities to household income,
has to be based on collection of detailed data on gross output, costs
of different inputs used in production, prices, and receipt of wages,
and derivation of household income from them (Rawal, 2008 \cite{vikasincome2008}).
In addition to collection of detailed data from households, estimation
of household income requires detailed methods of imputation for costs
of input that are not procured from the market and value of output
that is not sold in the market \cite{vikasincome2008}. While large
amount of data required for such estimations can not be collected as
part of consumer expenditure or employment-unemployment surveys, the
problem is not solved by leaving it to the respondent to figure out
how to answer vaguely formulated questions about household income.
</p>

<p>
Dhar (2013) \cite{nsdras2013} has discussed the long-standing problem
of lack of a methodology for obtaining accurate estimates of
contribution of different activities to household income. Focus of the
present note is on a new problem in the methodology of classification
of rural labour households. This problem has arisen on account of
changes in the method that is used to convert the information on
income shares into a scheme for classification of households. These
changes have been brought about in the surveys conducted as part of
the 68th round of NSSO, data from which have been released
recently.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
In this note, I show that, in an attempt to correct some gaps in the
method used for classification of rural households, NSSO has created
serious conceptual problems in the scheme of categorisation. Changes
in the method of classification introduced in the 68th round have made
it impossible to separately identify agricultural labour and rural
labour households in data from the 68th round survey. Instead of
correcting the way agricultural labour households and rural labour
households were identified prior to the 68th round, NSSO has created
new categories of households that are not only incomparable with the
categories of agricultural labour households and rural labour
households in earlier surveys, but have serious conceptual problems.
</p>

<p>
Section 2 of the note discusses the method used for categorisation of
rural households prior to the 68th round. Section 3 discusses the
changes introduced in the 68th round and their implications for
identification of rural labour households. Section 4 concludes with
suggestions about improving the methods of identification of rural
labour households in NSSO surveys.

</p>

<p>
1.9.5 Household type: The household type, based on the means of
livelihood of a household, is decided on the basis of the sources of
the household&rsquo;s income during the 365 days preceding the date of
survey. For this purpose, only the household&rsquo;s income (net income and
not gross income) from economic activities is to be considered; but
the incomes of servants and paying guests are not to be taken into
account.
</p>

<p>
In rural areas, a household will belong to any one of the following
five household types:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>self-employed in non-agriculture (SENA)</li>
<li>agricultural labour (AL)</li>
<li>other labour (OL)</li>
<li>self-employed in agriculture (SEA)</li>
<li>others (OTH)</li>
</ul>

<p>
For urban areas, the household types are: self-employed (SE), regular
wage/salary earning (RWS), casual labour (CL), others (OTH).
</p>

<p>
1.9.5.1 Procedure for determining household type in rural sector: For
a rural household, if a single source (among the five sources of
income listed above) contributes 50% or more of the household&rsquo;s income
from economic activities during the last 365 days, it will be assigned
the type corresponding to that source.
</p>

<p>
1.9.5.2 For a household to be classified as ‘agricultural labour’ (AL)
  or ‘self-employed in agriculture’ (SEA) its income from that source
  must be 50% or more of its total income. If there is no such source
  yielding 50% or more of the household&rsquo;s total income, it will be
  assigned one of the remaining types (SENA, OL or OTH) according to
  the following procedure.
</p>

<p>
1.9.5.3 To be classified as self-employed in non-agriculture (SENA),
   the household&rsquo;s income from that source must be greater than its
   income from rural labour (all wage-paid manual labour) as well as
   that from all other economic activities put together (a three-way
   division is to be considered here).
</p>

<p>
1.9.5.4 A household not assigned one of the types SENA, AL or SEA will
   be classified as other labour (OL) if its income from rural labour
   (all wage-paid manual labour) is greater than that from
   self-employment as well as that from other economic activities
   (again a three-way division). All other households will be
   classified under “others” (OTH).

<p>
It is clear from above that if a household derived at least half of
the income from own cultivation, it was classified as &ldquo;Self-employed
in agriculture&rdquo;. Similarly, if the household derived at least half of
its income from agricultural labour, it was classified as an
agricultural labour household. If a household did not derive 50 per
cent income from agricultural labour, but its share of income from
wage labour (agriculture and non-agriculture) was higher than the
share of income from own cultivation and from any non-agricultural
business it had, then the household was classified as &ldquo;other labour&rdquo;
household. Agricultural labour households and other labour households
together constituted rural labour households.
</p>

<p>
One limitation of this method was that salaried non-manual workers
were not separately identified and were classified as part of the
residual category &ldquo;others&rdquo;, which, in addition, would have included
households dependent primarily on pensions, remittances and other
forms of cash transfers, as well as destitute households.
</p>

<p>
Another problem with this scheme of classification was that rural
labour households for which agricultural labour did not contribute 50
per cent of household income but contributed more than the
contribution of non-agricultural labour were classified as &ldquo;other
labour&rdquo; and not as agricultural labour households. For example, if 40
per cent of income of a household came from agricultural labour, 20
per cent from non-agricultural labour and the rest from other sources,
the household would have been classified as &ldquo;other labour&rdquo; household
and not as agricultural labour household. As a result, &ldquo;other labour&rdquo;
households could include households that derived more income from
agricultural labour than from non-agricultural labour.

1.8.5 Household type:

only the household&rsquo;s income (net income and not gross income) from

</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>self-employed in agriculture</li>
<li>self-employed in non-agriculture</li>
<li>regular wage/salary earning</li>
<li>casual labour in agriculture</li>
<li>casual labour in non-agriculture others</li>
</ul>

<p>
For urban areas, the household types are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>self-employed</li>
<li>regular wage/salary earning</li>
<li>casual labour</li>
<li>others</li>
</ul>

<p>
1.8.5.1 Procedure for determining household type in rural sector: The
broad household types in rural areas to be used in this round are
self-employed, regular wage/salary earning, casual labour and others.
A household which does not have any income from economic activities
will be classified under others. Within each of the broad category of
self-employed and casual labours two specific household types will be
distinguished, depending on their major income from agricultural
activities (sections A of NIC-2008) and non-agricultural activities
(rest of the NIC-2008 sections, excluding section A). The specific
household types for self-employed are: self-employed in agriculture
and self-employed in non-agriculture. For casual labour, the specific
household types are: casual labour in agriculture and casual labour in
non-agriculture. In the determination of the household type in the
rural areas, first the household’s income from economic activities
will be considered. Rural household will be first categorized as
‘self-employed’, ‘regular wage/salary earning’ or ‘casual labour’
depending on the single major source of its income from economic
activities during last 365 days. Further, for those households which
are categorized either as self-employed or casual labours, specific
household types (self-employed in agriculture or self-employed in
non-agriculture and casual labour in agriculture or casual labour in
non-agriculture) will be assigned depending on the single major source
of income from agricultural or non-agricultural activities.
</p>

<p>
It may be noted that the household types and the procedure suggested
here for rural areas are different from those followed in NSS surveys
till now.

<p>
The new scheme of classification separately identifies households that
are primarily dependent on regular salaries/wages.
</p>

<p>
The first problem with the new scheme of classification is that it
does not separate non-manual employees from manual wage labourers.
Instead, it distinguishes casual wage labourers from regular
salaried/wage employees on the basis of regularity of payment of
wages/salaries. As a result, agricultural labourers and
non-agricultural labourers are not separately identified. The survey
instead identifies &ldquo;casual&rdquo; agricultural workers and &ldquo;casual&rdquo;
non-agricultural workers. Manual workers who are hired on a long-term
contract are now classified as households dependent on regular
salaried/wage earnings. In particular, according to this
classification, farm servants (long-term workers in agriculture) would
not be classified as part of agricultural labourer households but as
part of regular salaried households. Similarly, households dependent
on earnings of monthly-paid manual non-agricultural labourers (for
example, domestic workers, shop assistants, drivers, cleaners,
gardeners) would now be classified as salaried employee households.
</p>

<p>
As a result of this, there is no clear way of identifying agricultural
labour and rural labour households. The data can be used, at best, to
identify casual agricultural labour and casual rural labour
households.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, the new scheme of classification involves a two-stage
classification. In the first stage of classification, households are
categorised into self-employed, regular wage/salary earning, casual
labour and other households. In the second stage of classification,
self-employed households are classified into those who are primarily
self-employed in agriculture and those who are primarily self-employed
in non-agricultural enterprises. Similarly, in the second stage,
casual labour households are further classified into casual
agricultural labour households and casual non-agricultural labour
households. There is no second-stage classification of regular
wage/salary earning households and other households.
</p>

<p>
Given that casual workers and monthly-paid workers are separated in
the first stage, this two-stage classification has another obvious
problem. Suppose a household earns 35 per cent of its income from
casual agricultural labour, 25 per cent of its income from long-term
agricultural labour done by some members of the household, and 40 per
cent of its income from own-cultivation of land. By the new
classification, the household will be classified as self-employed in
agriculture despite the fact that 60 per cent of its income comes from
agricultural labour. Such a household would have been classified as an
agricultural labour household by the classification method used before
the 68th round.
</p>

<p>
In other words, the new two stage classification scheme under-counts
rural labour households. Some rural labour households are separately
classified along with salaried non-manual workers into a new category
of regular salaried/wage earning households. On the other hand, some
households that are primarily dependent on rural labour are classified
now as self-employed (presumably primarily in agriculture but also in
non-agriculture).
</p>

<p>
Table <a href="#org16fb96d">1</a> shows proportion of rural households divided
into different categories of household type for NSSO large-sample
rounds starting 1993-94. The table shows that the proportion of casual
agricultural labour households from the 68th round survey was 4.6
percentage points lower than the proportion of agricultural labour
households in the 66th round survey conducted just two years earlier.
Proportion of &ldquo;other labour&rdquo; in the rural population increased
consistently from 1993-94 till 2009-10. It is interesting to note that
the proportion of casual non-agricultural labour households from the
68th round survey was 1.3 percentage points lower than the proportion
of &ldquo;other labour&rdquo; households in the 66th round survey. Consistent with
the explanation given above, proportion of households that were
self-employed in agriculture from the 68th round survey was 2.4
percentage points higher than the corresponding proportion from the
66th round survey.
</p>

<p>
This pattern of change between the 66th round and the 68th round
survey is consistent with the explanation that it is likely to have
been driven by the change in methodology of classification.

<h2 id="orgbbe9dd9"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Proposals for improving the method of identification of rural labour households</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Classification of rural households requires a consistent estimation of
contribution of different activities to income of households and a
conceptually sound method of using this information to classify
households.
</p>

<p>
Most rural workers are either engaged in household enterprises or work
as hired workers under casual contracts. Given this, rural households
do not have any need to maintain, and are often incapable of
maintaining, detailed account of their economic activities. In such a
situation, accurate measurement of contribution of different
activities to household income has to be based on collection of
extremely detailed data on processes of production and other economic
activities that households are engaged in. In addition, such a
measurement would require consistent methods of dealing with
intermediate products of household enterprises as well as commodities
that are produced and self-consumed by households. Measurement of
incomes would also require a consistent method of imputation of value
of labour and owned assets deployed in the economic activities of
households.
</p>

<p>
The NSSO has, so far, shied away from the challenge of designing a
survey for collection of reliable and accurate data on household
incomes.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> The need for NSSO to seriously engage in
collection of statistics on household incomes cannot be
over-emphasised.
</p>

<p>
However, since Surveys of Consumer Expenditure and Surveys of
Employment and Unemployment are already extremely time consuming,
additional collection of detailed data on household income as part of
these surveys is not likely to be feasible. In view of this, devising
methods that can be used for reliable measurement of share of income
from different sources as part of these surveys, without incorporating
a full-blown survey of incomes, is even more challenging. NSSO needs
to address this problem rather than leave it to ingenuity of
investigators to figure out a method of determining share of income
coming from different sources.
</p>

<p>
A starting point for improving collection of information on
contribution of different economic activities to household income
would be to include a reasonably clear statement of what is meant by
<i>net</i> incomes in the instruction manuals. The manuals should clearly
specify costs that are expected to be accounted for in the
measurement. For rural households, it would be particularly important
to have a detailed discussion of the concepts to be used for
agriculture, income from animal resources and other non-agricultural
businesses. <sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Further, instruction manuals should have a clear discussion of the
difficulty in determining the primary source of income for cultivators
who combine cultivation on small operational holding of land with wage
labour. It is important to sensitise investigators to this problem so
that extra care is taken in determining income shares for such
households.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the NSSO schedule should require the investigators to record
the share of different types of activities in total household income
along with household type, so that statistical testing could be done
on relationship between these shares and other variables to determine
reliability of classification of households.
</p>

<p>
Since the 68th round surveys, NSSO has adopted a new method for
classification of rural households. This note shows that the new
scheme for classification of rural households is conceptually flawed.
The new scheme results in an under-counting of rural labour households
as only casual labour households separately identified and long-term
manual workers are classified as part of a new category that includes
salaried non-manual employees along with long-term manual workers.
Further, the scheme of classification is such that some of the manual
worker households are likely to get classified as self-employed
despite their being primarily dependent on wage labour.
</p>

<p>
NSSO must make a correction and adopt a conceptually consistent method
of classification of households. It is important that the method of
classification of rural households is revised before the next
large-sample survey so that a consistent classification is used for
the next Rural Labour Enquiry. I would like to propose that the
correct scheme of classification should be on the following lines.
</p>

<p>
In the first stage, households should be divided between rural labour
households, households self-employed in agriculture, households
self-employed in non-agricultural enterprises, households primarily
dependent on non-manual salaried employment, and other households.
This classification should be based on which of the following is the
most important source of income: manual wage labour, self-employment
in agriculture, self-employment in non-agricultural enterprises,
non-manual salaried employment, or any other.
</p>

<p>
In the second stage, households primarily dependent on manual wage
labour should be sub-divided into agricultural and other labour
households on the basis of whether agricultural labour or
non-agricultural labour provides a higher share of total household
income.
</p>

<p>
Conceptually, the definition of rural labour households in the
proposed method is same as the definition of rural labour households
used prior to the 68th round survey. As was discussed in Section
<a href="#orgf11fe7a">2</a>, a problem with the method of classification of households used
prior to the 68th round was that some households with greater income
from agricultural labour than from non-agricultural labour were
wrongly classified as &ldquo;other labour&rdquo; households rather than as
agricultural labour households. The proposed method would correct that
anomaly.

The decision to conduct large-sample consumer expenditure and
employment-unemployment surveys as part of the 68th round has been
controversial. The National Statistical Commission has argued that it
mandated NSSO to conduct a large-sample round on the grounds that the
reference year of the previous quinquennial round (66th round,
2009-10) was not a normal agricultural year (Anant, 2013
\cite{tcahindu2013}).  Commentators have, however, pointed out that
the unusual timing of the large-sample survey may have been determined
by other, political, considerations (see, for example, Chandrasekhar
and Ghosh, 2013\cite{cpcjg08072013} and The Hindu, 2013
\cite{hinduedit25072013}).
