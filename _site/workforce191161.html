<p>
All Subsidiary Tables related to 1961 Census except Tables B-1.6 and
B-II.3 are being published in Parts I-C(i) and I-C(ii). It was
considered appropriate to publish Tables B-1.6 and B-II.3 as a
separate Census Paper because of the specialised nature of the data
contained in these tables which may be used by research scholars and
demographers. In Table B-I.6, workers are classified by broad
industrial categories and by States and Union Territories from
1901/1911-1961. In Table B-II.3, workers in each city and town group
are classified by broad industrial categories from 1901/1911-1961. For
each Table, workers per 1,000 of population and distribution of
workers by broad industrial categories per 1,000 of total workers are
also worked out.
</p>

<p>
Comparable series of working force were published for the first time
in Paper No. 1 of 1962 (Final Population Totals). The methodology, on
the basis of which the present Tables have been prepared, has since
undergone some change as a result of incorporating the suggestions of
the Study Group on Comparability of Census Economic Classification set
up by this office. The Tables were prepared in the Research Unit of
this office and Har Gopal Saini, V. A. Deshmukh, H. C. Agarwal, Prem
Kanta, Ved Prakash and R. K. Choudhary assisted in the intricate
computational work involved in these Tables. Shri B. R. Kalra,
Research Officer under whose guidance the tabulation was done has done
a commendable job. To all of them my thanks are due.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7ae5cf9">
<p>
The methodology used for working out figures of workers and
non-workers in 1901-1951 (except 1941) and their distribution in nine
borad industrial categories according to 1961 Census is given
below. The figures in Subsidiary Tables B-I.6 and B-II.3 are worked
out on the lines of this methodology.

<div id="outline-container-org2a725ea" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org2a725ea">Workers in 1951 comprised</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2a725ea">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All self-supporting persons with productive principal means of
livelihood, i.e., all self- supporting persons other than (a)
agricultural rent receivers belonging to livelihood Class IV and
(b) self- supporting persons deriving their means of livelihood
form non-agricultural, non- productive occupations, like beggers,
persioners, etc., belonging to livelihood Class VIII</li>

<li>Self-supporting persons belonging to livelihood Class IV
(agricultural rent receivers) but deriving secondary means of
livelihood from productive occupations, i.e., other than Class IV;
and</li>

<li><p>
All earning dependents in respect of their own (secondary) means of
livelihood other than those who derived their secondary means of
livelihood from:-
</p>

<p>
(a) Receipt agricultural rent under Class IV, and
</p>

<p>
(b) Non-agricultural non- productive occupations. ( For calculating
working force, no account has been made of the self-supporting
persons whose principal means of livelihood was non-agricultural
non-productive but who had a productive secondary means of
livelihood, as unlike rent receivers in Class IV, these persons
were lumped in class VIII and did not have a separate class of
principal or secondary means of livelihood).
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Earning dependents, however, were classified only into 8 livelihood
classes and there was no further break-up of them into divisions and
sub-divisions or groups.
</p>


<p>
On the experience of 1961 it was presumed that the earning dependent
in 1951 also generally belonged to the household sector and were
mostly family workers in the non-household sector. This is of course a
big assumption to make but seems warranted by 1961
experience. Livelihood Class V corresponds with, Division, O-3 of
ISIC. Workers in household industry at two-digit level in 1961
covering Divisions 0-3 of ISIC, were added to family workers at
non-household industry and their proportions at two-digit level were
worked out for livelihood Class V of 1951. The earning dependents of
livelihood Class V of 1951 were allocated to major groups of ISIC on
the basis of the proportions so worked out. Earning dependents in
livelihood Class VI, VII and VIII of 1951 were allocated to major
groups of 1961 on the basis of the distribution of the family workers
of 1961. For this purpose, family workers of major groups for 1961
were first recast into livelihood classes of 1951 and their
proportions for each livelihood class were worked out. The earning
dependent belongings to each livelihood class were then distributed on
the basis of the proportions so worked out. The figures so obtained at
major group level were consolidated into nine industrial categories
on 1961.

industrial classification.

<p>
The figures presented in Table B-I.6 are on the basis of re-organised
States and are, thus, comparable. Changes into district level have
been effected by including or excluding and entire district from a
particular state as the case was. Adjustment below district level were
made on the basis of population on a pro-rate basis, similarly,
figures of working force for cities and towns in TableB-II.3 are also
adjusted on the basis of comparative figures of population on a
pro-rate basis.
