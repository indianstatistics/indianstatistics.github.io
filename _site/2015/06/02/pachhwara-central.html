<p>
Privatisation of coal mining in Amrapara block of Pakur district by
the NDA and UPA governments has facilitated a loot of national
resources by a private company and deprived poor adivasi peasants of
benefits from resources that rightfully belong to them. Mineral
resources cannot be mined without the consent of adivasis, without
fully compensating them, and without ensuring that a reasonable share
of benefits from the use of this wealth goes back to them. This is the
fundamental principle on which policies related to coal and other
minerals have to be based.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org72720c2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org72720c2"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
In line with the policies of liberalisation adopted in 1991,
successive governments since the early 1990s have sought to subvert
nationalisation of coal through disguised privatisation. The mining
capacity of public sector coal companies has been severely reduced
through retrenchment, incentivising early retirements and imposing
controls on recruitment. Consequently, public sector coal companies
have been forced to increasingly rely on subcontracting mining
operations to private contractors. Starting in the late 1990s, first
under the Vajpayee government and then under the two Manmohan Singh
governments, joint ventures of public sector firms and private
companies were allocated coal blocks and given permission to undertake
mining, an activity that was hitherto reserved only for the public
sector.
</p>

<p>
In 2002, the Vajpayee government allocated Pachhwara Central coal
mines in Amrapara block of Pakur district (Jharkhand) to PANEM Coal
Mines Ltd., a Joint Venture company of the Punjab State Electricity
Board (later renamed Punjab State Power Corporation Limited, PSPCL)
and Eastern Minerals and Trading Agency (EMTA, then a partnership firm
owned by Ujjal Upadhyay). Starting in 2006-07, PANEM Coal Mines Ltd
mined and supplied up to 8 million tonnes of coal annually to PSPCL,
sending roughly six to eight rakes of coal to Punjab every day.
</p>

<p>
As was the case with most coal block allocations done by the Vajpayee
and the Manmohan Singh governments, the PSPCL-EMTA Joint Venture, in
which PSPCL had only a 26 per cent stake, was nothing but a way to
bypass the regulation that reserved coal blocks like Pachhwara Central
for public sector companies. In March 2015, CAG submitted a report to
the Punjab Legislative Assembly pointing to grave irregularities in
formation of the Joint Venture and subsequent approval by PSPCL of the
substitution of the EMTA partnership firm with EMTA Coal Ltd. Official
records of PSEB cited in the CAG report show that PSEB was not
planning to apply for allocation of a captive coal block, and did so
only at EMTA&rsquo;s bidding and with all expenses for identification of
coal block having been borne by EMTA. Although a joint venture, PANEM
was completely controlled by EMTA. As per the original agreement
between PSEB and EMTA, 23 per cent of the share capital was to be
offered to financial institutions, mutual funds and general public. In
reality, most of it was held by the family members of the EMTA
owners. In 2010, EMTA was converted into a company and registered
under the Companies Act, 1956. EMTA, partners of EMTA and their
relatives together owned 72.23 per cent of equity of PANEM and
exercised full control over its functioning.
</p>

<p>
There were serious malpractices in day-to-day working of PANEM. The
CMD of EMTA also served as Managing Director of PANEM. Mining
operations were sub-contracted to EMTA, and EMTA booked excess
expenses in accounts of PANEM, which were not verified by PSPCL.
</p>

<p>
The price of coal paid by PSPCL was not based on cost of production
but on the basis of average rates of Coal India. Since Pachhwara
Central is an open cast mine, and a very shallow one at that (so
shallow that in the area coal can be dug out from just a few feet
below the ground), the cost of production should have been much lower
than the average rate of Coal India. The CAG estimated that in a
single year (2013-14), PSPCL paid an excess of Rs. 29.59 crores
because the price of coal was not based on production cost.
</p>

<p>
The CAG report summarised its findings in respect of PSPCL as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Process for selecting JV partner through tenders were full of
ambiguity yet the Company did not consider the desirability of
inviting the bids afresh despite expert opinion. Rates for supply of
coal were based on CIL rates instead of being based on production cost
plus profit. Non determination of coal price on cost to produce basis
resulted in extra payment of Rs. 29.59 crores to PANEM/EMTA in respect
of grade D coal supplied to PSPCL during 2013-14 alone. The structure
of share capital was not followed as per agreement. Partnership firm
was allowed to convert into a company and PANEM was allowed to book
expenditure incurred by EMTA without verification. The mining
operations were sub contracted to EMTA. There was delay in
commencement of mining activities; washery and railway siding were not
installed by JV partner, EMTA. Supply of entire mined coal as per its
quality was not assured. PANEM was not impressed upon to discharge
liability for mine closure plan.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Providing about 70 per cent of coal to Punjab’s three most crucial
power plants (Bhatinda, Ropar and Lehra Mohabbat plants), PANEM held
PSPCL to ransom in 2014 over demands for increasing price of coal and
advance payments for freight charges. PANEM curtailed supplies of coal
to PSPCL, creating a crisis in Punjab and forcing PSPCL to cut
electricity supply. Eventually, PSPCL had to give in to the demands of
PANEM, and start paying Rs. 6 crore every day as advance towards
freight charges and Rs. 100 per metric tonne as advance towards price
of coal charged by PANEM.

<h2 id="org1bad2d3"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Impact of Mining on Lives of Adivasis in Amrapara</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Over the nine years of operating Pachhwara Central mines, PANEM dug
out vast quantities of mineral wealth from under the ground in
Amrapara. Destroying forests, agriculture, and livelihoods of Santhal
adivasi peasants in the area, coal was fed to power plants in
Punjab. Over these nine years, PANEM went emptying mine after mine in
the coal block. In some cases, open cast mines were simply abandoned,
in which cattle would fall and die. On the side of such mines, PANEM
left mountains of overburden and rubble. Of course, at least
officially, the plans were to rehabilitate the mines – flattening the
accumulated overburden, re-filling the pits removed, and recreating
land for agricultural use. In reality, only some open cast mines were
re-filled, others just abandoned, and none rehabilitated for any kind
of use.
</p>

<p>
In the meanwhile, Santhal adivasis in the area continue to live a life
of abject poverty. While coal from beneath their feet lit up Punjab,
they continue to burn kerosene lamps to light their little huts. In a
village we visited next to the Pachhwara Central mine, no house had a
toilet or drinking water facility on premises. In summer, people have
to walk several kilometres to get water, as groundwater table has
plunged because of mining. And there is coal dust everywhere – in the
air, on their houses, on streets and on road – not only creating
enormous hardship but also exposing the local population to diseases
like asthma.
</p>

<p>
Mining created no jobs for the adivasis. With highly mechanised
mining, PANEM employees – not only operators of those machines but
even the security guards – were all outsiders. The economic gain of
adivasis was limited to scavenging and selling coal that fell on the
road as coal-laden trucks left PANEM mines. The organised mafia did a
little better, as they occasionally stopped these trucks and offloaded
a part of the coal, robbing the robbers.
</p>

<p>
Farms of adivasi peasants in the area are repositories of incredible
on-farm biodiversity. The land that awaits destruction by mining
companies has thickly wooded forests with an enormous diversity of
trees. These forests are a crucial resource for adivasis. Seasonal
fruits, vegetables and edible leaves they collect from the forest are
an extremely important source of nutrition. Their animals graze in the
forest. Firewood they burn in their kitchen is collected from these
forests. All of this has been severely restricted because of expanding
area of the mines.
</p>

<p>
Most adivasis continue to work the small pieces of land that they are
left with. However, with no access to bank credit, no public
investment in irrigation, no agricultural extension, and little
resources to buy modern inputs, agriculture is characterised with low
yields, negligible surpluses and meagre incomes. For their cash
requirements, most workers &#x2013; men and women &#x2013; migrate to West Bengal
to work as agricultural labourers, transplanting or harvesting paddy
for meagre wages, or to work in brick kilns, stacking unburnt bricks
in the kilns and removing them after they have been burnt.

<h2 id="org6078545"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Cancellation of Allotment to PANEM</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
In September 2014, the Supreme Court ordered cancellation of allotment
of 204 blocks, calling the process of allotment “fatally flawed”. The
Supreme Court allowed original allottees in mines like Pachhwara
Central, where mining had been going on, to continue mining for six
months, until March 31st, to avoid disruption of power generation and
facilitate continuation as fresh allotments are done by the
government.
</p>

<p>
PANEM mined every single tonne of coal that it could till March 31,
2015, and then left the mine exposed without taking any precaution for
safety of mines or of poor adivasis living in villages around the
mines. Open mines were abandoned as they were and no land was
restored.

<div id="outline-container-org1766faa" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1766faa"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Re-allotment of Pachhwara Central Coal Block</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
When coal block allotment was cancelled, the Supreme Court imposed an
additional levy of Rs. 295 per tonne of coal mined. For about 49
million tonnes of coal that had been mined from the Pachhwara Central
mines, the compensation was estimated to be about Rs. 1460
crores. Despite Supreme Court’s direction that the additional levy be
paid within a period of three months and in no case later than
December 31, 2014, EMTA refused to pay its share of the
compensation. PSPCL paid its share (26 per cent, equivalent to the
equity it held in PANEM) of Rs. 391 crores, only to avoid being
disqualified from bidding for fresh allotment of Pachhwara Central
coal block.
</p>

<p>
In the latest round of allotments, Pachhwara Central was reserved for
allotment only to public sector. Having paid just their share of levy,
and despite the fact that bulk of the levy had not been paid because
of EMTA’s refusal to abide by Supreme Court’s instructions, PSCPL
applied for and was awarded the contract for mining coal from the
Pachhwara Central mines. Following the re-allotment, on March 31st,
PANEM handed over the control over mine to PSPCL.
</p>

<p>
While the mine has been formally handed over to PSPCL, PSPCL has no
capacity to either operate or ensure safety of the mine. Security
staff deputed by PANEM continue to regulate entry to the mine
area. PANEM continues to have its staff there, who are instructed to
just stand by and wait for further instructions.
</p>

<p>
With formal handing over of the mine to PSPCL, all mining activity was
halted and all mines were left as they were: with coal exposed to
atmospheric heat, open pits in which stray cattle would fall to their
death, and mountains of overburden.
</p>

<p>
When PANEM handed over the mine, it took no precautions to ensure
safety of exposed coal. Freshly mined and exposed coal absorbs oxygen
quickly. Coal heats particularly quickly in present of atmospheric
moisture and self-ignites. In early May, with sporadic rains causing a
rise in atmospheric moisture and soaring summer temperatures, exposed
coal in the mine caught fire. When we visited the area, the entire
mine was a spectacle of fire and rising clouds of smoke.

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 4: </span>Fire in the Pachhwara Central Coal Mines, May 2015</p>
</div>

<p>
Since early May 2015, precious coal is burning in Pachhwara Central
mines. Not having being paid to do anything about it, PANEM/EMTA has
decided to just watch the coal burn and do nothing other than
preventing entry to the area (security staff of PANEM continue to
guard the entrance to the mine). PANEM officials have been saying that
unless fires were not put out quickly, they could spread to the entire
mine as well as to neighbouring mines.
</p>

<p>
While at the face of it, the new allotment was done to a public sector
entity, in reality, the allottee (PSPCL) has no capacity or experience
of coal mining. Given this, it was clear that PSPCL can only operate
the mine by subcontracting the operations to a private mining
contractor. The fact that EMTA had existing capacity &#x2013; machinery,
buildings and personnel &#x2013; to mine in Pachhwara Central, it could
start the mining activity sooner than any other competitor. Urgency of
dealing with fires have put additional pressure on PSPCL to award the
contract to EMTA so that the fires could be put out at the earliest
and mining operations started.
</p>

<p>
It has been reported that PSPCL and EMTA have agreed that EMTA will
put out the fires, and that PSPCL will bear the cost for doing
so. PSPCL team that visited Pachhwara announced that the mining
operations by EMTA will start at the earliest.
</p>

<p>
With a huge demand for electricity to cater to, PSPCL had little
choice but to pay a hefty price to EMTA to restart mining.
</p>

<p>
The facade that was
created in the name of PANEM is not needed any more. PSPCL has
directly entered into a contract with EMTA. After disruption of a few
months, and despite having defaulted on the payment of over Rs. 1000
crores worth of levy imposed by the Supreme Court, EMTA is all set to
come back to rule Pachhwara mines.

<div id="outline-container-org2d5b340" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2d5b340"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Modi Government&rsquo;s Policy on Coal</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
In his speech in Mathura marking a year of his government, Narendra
Modi boasted that his government had brought an end to the loot of
coal allowed by the Manmohan Singh government. He claimed that the new
policy would result in a part of benefits from mining going back for
development of adivasis in the areas where mining was going to take
place.
</p>

<p>
Nothing could be farther from truth. Since the early 1990s, both the
Congress- and the BJP-led governments have pursued policies for
surreptitious and incremental privatisation of coal mining. Pacchwara
Coal Mine, one of the biggest coal blocks available for allotment in
Jharkhand, has been allotted to PSPCL for free. The mining operations
in that mine have been subcontracted to the same company that was
managing the operations before. This has happened despite the fact
that the EMTA has defaulted on payment of over Rs. 1000 crores of
levy. With PSPCL having no presence whatsoever in Amrapara/Pachhwara,
the contract gives the company complete control over operations in
Pachhwara.
</p>

<p>
Nationalisation of coal has been subverted and privatisation has been
promoted through various means by Congress- and BJP-led governments
over the last two decades. As on most economic issues, Modi
government&rsquo;s policies on coal are nothing but old wine in new
bottle. In the domain of economic policies, everything that was wrong
with the Manmohan Singh regime has been taken one step further by the
Modi government – giving even greater benefits to India Inc., pushing
people completely out of the development scene, attacking marginalised
communities, and smartly repackaging it all to give it legal
legitimacy.

<div id="outline-container-org6776e45" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6776e45"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Course-correction in Policies on Coal and Other Minerals</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Mineral wealth under the land of adivasis belongs to them. Rights of
these adivasis over land and these minerals must be recognised. Any
attempt to rob the rightful owners of this wealth must be
defeated. Mineral resources cannot be mined without the consent of
adivasis, without fully compensating them, and without ensuring that a
reasonable share of benefits from the use of this wealth goes back to
them. This is the fundamental principle on which policies related to
coal and other minerals have to be based.
</p>

<p>
Government policies on coal mining require a major course
correction. Such a course correction has to involve the following:
</p>

<p>
<b>Reversal of privatisation:</b> It is crucial that public control over coal
and other mineral resources is re-established fully, privatisation in
all forms is reversed, and coal mining brought back fully in control
of the public sector mining companies.
</p>

<p>
<b>Using coal and other minerals for industrialisation of mineral-rich
States:</b> Coal from States like Jharkhand is mined, transported to
various States, and fed to power plants in these States. It should be
required that power generation companies invest in power plants in
States where coal is mined, and generate power that can then be sold
to power distributors in other States. Such investment would fuel
industrialisation in these mineral-rich States, generate employment,
and provide at least a part of the electricity generated to people of
that State. Transporting coal and other minerals from mineral rich
States to industrially advanced States instead of investing in in-situ
generation of electricity and other mineral-based industries is
nothing but a recipe for de-industrialisation in mineral-rich States.
</p>

<p>
<b>Protecting the rights of adivasis and using mineral resources for
their development:</b> The question of the impact of mining on conditions
of life and livelihoods of villages in the mining area remains
crucial. It is completely unacceptable that power generated from this
coal is only used for air-conditioning corporate offices and homes of
the urban rich, while poor adivasis who have the first natural claim
on these resources light kerosene lamps in their huts.
</p>

<p>
In the context of Pachhwara Central Coal Mines, following immediate
actions are required: PANEM/EMTA should be made to extinguish the fire
at their own cost, and take the responsibility of mine safety for a
reasonably specified period. PANEM/EMTA should be made to pay their
share of levy as determined by the Supreme Court. In addition,
PANEM/EMTA should be made to pay for rehabilitation of the mines from
which they have extracted coal for the last nine years.
