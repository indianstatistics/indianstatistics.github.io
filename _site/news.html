The central government has finally allowed the release of the report of the 2017-18 Periodic Labour Force Survey. The previous government had blocked its release before elections because the survey showed a massive increase in the unemployment rate, worst in the last 45 years. Some data from the report that were leaked in the media showed that there had been a massive contraction in rural employment. In these Lok Sabha elections, BJP tried every trick, and with remarkable success, to distract the voters away from issues such as unemployment and livelihoods. The report perhaps saw light of the day formally only because, having won the elections with a massive mandate, the primary purpose of blocking the release of this report ceased to be relevant.

        <span>(2018-06-05)</span>

      <em><p>
The agrarian sector of the economy has been suffering from an intense crisis over the last four years. The agrarian distress, whose origins lie in long-term neglect of agriculture particularly after 1991, intensified greatly over the last few years because of adverse impact of a series of decisions taken by the NDA government. Government policies over the last four years show an unprecedented level of neglect towards agriculture and farmers. Having capitalised on the poor performance of the UPA-II government in addressing concerns of the farmers, the NDA government only went on to further neglect agriculture and the rural economy. Worse still, several decisions have been taken by the present government to benefit big corporates and agro-business companies at the expense of farmers. Agricultural insurance was opened to private sector and a huge largesse has been given by the government to insurance companies in the form of premium payments while farmers have got little compensation for crop losses. While corporate fraudsters have milked the pubic sector banks dry, bringing many of them to the brink of a collapse, not even peanuts have been offered to farmers reeling under debt. There are no government controls on prices of seeds, pesticides and other plant protection chemicals, and fertilisers other than urea. Agro-business companies are free to set prices of these crucial inputs, many of them patented and produced by large monopoly transnational corporations, at whatever level they like. While global oil prices have remained low for most part of the last four years, government has used it as an opportunity to mop up excise duty and fund tax breaks and largesse given to big corporates. This has meant that prices of diesel — a key agricultural input for running pumps, tractors and other machinery — have remained high, and increased more than even prices of petrol, despite the global oil prices having fallen.

Nurjamal Haq, a peasant from Dhubri district of Assam, has 1.3 acres of land. The total income over paid out expenses, from a whole year of work on 1.3 acres of land, was just Rs. 10,505. Nurjamal said, &ldquo;with demonetisation, our lives were set on fire&rdquo;. He stood in the queue at around 3 AM hoping to get some money, but was told in the evening that there was no money left. Prices of rabi crops fell sharply as traders were unwilling to buy anything. Although Nurjamal managed to sell his mustard crop, the trader held back payment for want of cash, and gave him money only two months later. With no payment from buyers of their produce, cultivators like Nurjamal were forced to buy inputs on credit. In the desperate situation that the peasants were, input dealers charged exorbitant, &ldquo;whatever they wished&rdquo;, prices.

With no support coming from the government, the crash in prices left chilli farmers like Udumula Balreddy in extreme distress. Udumula took a crop loan of Rs. 1 lakh from a bank.

If we account for the value of large amount of labour done by four members of the family and value other households resources that were deployed on the land, the total income from 11 acres of their land was only about Rs. 48,000.

Basavaraju, a deeply indebted peasant from Hassan, Karnataka. Of Basavaraju’s 7 acres land about half is tubewell irrigated on which they grow potato, ginger, tomato and chilly. When we interviewed Basavaraju in the Kisan Mukti Sansad, the household had a total outstanding debt of Rs 9.40 lakhs. Of this 6 lakhs were owed to a bank where the interest rate is about 7 per cent. About 3 lakhs had been borrowed from traders in Belur and Halebidu and from various informal lenders in the village. Most of these lenders charged an interest of 36 per cent per annum on the loan. In 2014, Basavaraju’s wife gave away her gold jewellery to obtain a gold loan from a bank in order to repay earlier high interest loans taken from local moneylenders. She has no gold left any more to pawn for a cheaper bank loan. Given the low levels of income this year again, the threat of having to sell a part of their land looms large on the family.

Ravindra Babu Dhanwa is an adivasi peasant from Palghar, Maharashtra. Ravindra Babu, belonging to the Malhar Koli tribe, is from Ambhai village in Vada Tehsil of Palghar district, Maharashtra. Most of the land they possess is undulating and rock-strewn, and only about 1.5 acres is cultivable. The land is unirrigated and single-cropped. While the family cannot make their ends meet with production on this small amount of land, food they produce on this land is crucial for their food security. They produced not only 12 quintals of paddy for self-consumption, but also a little bit of urad, tur, ragi and bajra. Adivasis like Ravindra Babu have been part of a series of agitations in Palghar to protect their land, and in turn, to protect their livelihoods and food security. This is the struggle that brought him all the way to Delhi to participate in the Kisan Mukti Sansad in November 2017.

Students from Jawaharlal Nehru University, with support from the Society for Social and Economic Research, conducted detailed interviews of 51 farmers from various States on the sidelines of the <i>Kisan Mukti Sansad</i> in New Delhi on November 21-22, 2017. This was done with a view to interview farmers from different parts of India. Although no formal sampling was possible, the group tried to cover farmers from different regions, farmers growing different crops, and farmers belonging to different socio-economic categories. These interviews were based on a structured survey schedule which included information on the household details, land holdings, crops cultivated, cost of production and returns from agriculture and incomes from other sources. In this series, we shall present brief profiles of selected farmers interviewed by the group.

This book raises some compelling questions that scholars working on the issue of land grab need to grapple with. For far too long, the land grab literature has used varied definitions of the term land grab and presented empirical estimates without specifying a consistent methodological framework for assessment of the extent of land grab. Do all land transactions &#x2013; irrespective of whether domestic or transnational, irrespective of the class position of the sellers and buyers, irrespective of the role of state in facilitating the transactions, and irrespective of the land use before and after land transaction &#x2013; constitute land grab? Brautigam has used data compiled through painstaking fieldwork to show that some of the widely used estimates of Chinese investments in land acquisition in Africa are misleading. Does this problem go beyond the estimates of Chinese land acquisitions and extend to global estimates of land grab?

      <em><p>
Analysing household level data from three consecutive All India Debt and Investment Surveys (AIDIS) covering a period of two decades (1991-92 to 2012-13), this study finds that inequality in asset ownership in India has risen during this period. While inequality has risen in both rural and urban India, urban inequality is much higher, and the pace towards higher inequality is much faster in urban than in rural India. The growing inequality, in both rural and urban India, was mostly driven by highly unequal holding of land and buildings, the two most important forms in which Indian households hold their wealth. In terms of asset accumulation, there was no improvement for socially marginalised groups (Dalit, Adivasi and Muslim) relative to others (non-Dalit, non-Adivasi and non-Muslim), as <i>others</i> continued to own, on an average, more than double the assets of Dalit, Adivasi and Muslim households during the entire two decades. Non-Dalit, non-Adivasi and non-Muslim households remain a highly heterogeneous group, with much higher within group inequality than the marginalised groups.

This paper presents a study of the impact of land acquisition and displacement on the livelihoods of people in Belgaria, a village in Dhanbad district in Jharkhand. The study village, Belgaria, is on the margins of the coal mines in Jharia. Agricultural land acquired from the village in 1982 was used to construct a township and rehabilitate about 1200 families displaced by underground fires and land subsidence in Jharia. Using this village as a case study, this paper shows that, in a location with considerable degree of differentiation in ownership of land, the impact of land acquisition on livelihoods of people can vary across households belonging to different classes. Evidence from the new Belgaria township, where families displaced by underground fires were rehabilitated, shows that the resilience with which displaced workers coped with the disruption in access to livelihoods varied across male and female workers, and across socio-economic status of displaced households. Livelihoods of workers who were engaged in casual labour in the coal fields, in particular women workers, were most adversely affected due to displacement.

scheme for classification of households. Instead of correcting the way

This study deals with a new statistical domain, that of the village
(or gram) panchayat. This domain has emerged in rural India as a
consequence of the decentralisation programme initiated by the 73rd
Amendment to the Indian Constitution. The work of the Expert Committee
on Basic Statistics for Local-Level Development represents a landmark
in this regard because it sheds light on the potential of
village-level data sources for the new era of democratic
decentralisation in India. This paper examines data sources at the
gram panchayat level in relation to the needs that are generated if
the Constitution (73rd Amendment) Act, 1992 is implemented
comprehensively. From this point of view, the paper identifies three
categories of data needs. These are: data required for
self-governance, of which data required for managing the transition to
full-scope constitutional devolution are a special component (Data
Needs I and Ia); data required for matters of public finance (Data
Needs II); and data required for micro-level planning (and plan
implementation) for economic development and social justice (Data
Needs III).

emerge from the analysis: there has been a sharp rise in landlessness
in rural India; caste disparities in access to land have persisted
over time; there has been a rise in inequality in distribution of land
cultivated by households; and there has been a decline in the
proportion of manual labour households that combined wage labour with
cultivation of small holdings. Finally, statistics on land
distribution at the State level reveal some puzzling features – some
of which point to possible errors in data collection.

&ldquo;The growth of gross domestic product in every sub-sector of the
Indian economy accelerated during the second half of the 2000s,

in most sectors except construction decelerated. This jobless growth
was partly the result of positive changes such as the reduction of

half-decade, and an expansion in the population of students. Rural
wages rose and average educational levels of the workforce improved.
Government interventions in rural India since the mid-2000s,
particularly the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee
Act, seemed to have aided these positive transformations. However,
manufacturing employment in the country fell and employment growth
slowed down in most constituents of the services sector. The new jobs
generated were predominantly in rural construction. The slow progress
in the diversification of India&rsquo;s employment structure has led to
