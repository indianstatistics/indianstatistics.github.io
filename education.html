<p>
Illiteracy and lack of school education for all continue to be a major
aspect of the socio-economic underdevelopment in India.

<h2 id="org96efbb4">Literacy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org96efbb4">
<p>
Data on levels of literacy are collected as part of
<a href="http://censusindia.gov.in">population census</a>, in most NSS surveys of households, as well as in other
large-scale surveys like the <a href="http://www.nfhsindia.org">National Family Health Survey</a>.
</p>

<p>
In large-scale surveys literacy is normally ascertained by asking the
respondents about whether they can read and write. Instructions in the
NSS Instruction Manual for the 66th round surveys are illustrative in
this regard.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A person who can both read and write a simple message with
understanding in at least one language is to be considered literate.
Those who are not able to do so are to be considered not literate and
will be assigned code 01. Some persons achieve literacy by attending
Non-formal Education Courses (NFEC) or Adult Education Centres (AEC)
or by attending primary schools created under Education Guarantee
Scheme (EGS). Such persons will be given code 02. 
</p>

<p>
Those who achieved literacy through Total Literacy Campaign (TLC) will
be given code 03. Other literates without formal schooling will be
given code 04. 3.4.7.2 Those who achieved literacy through formal
schooling (excluding schools created under EGS) but are yet to pass
the primary standard examination will be assigned code 05. Similarly
codes 06-08 and 10-13 will be assigned to those who have passed the
appropriate levels. The criteria for deciding primary, middle,
secondary, etc. levels will be that followed in the concerned
States/Union Territories. Persons who have attained proficiency in
Oriental languages (e.g., Sanskrit, Persian, etc.) through formal but
not through the general type of education will be classified
appropriately at the equivalent level of general education standard.
Those who have completed some diploma or certificate course in
general, technical education or vocational education which is
equivalent to below-graduation level, will be assigned code 11. On the
other hand, those who have obtained degree or diploma or certificate
in general, technical education or vocational education, which is
equivalent to graduation level, will be given code 12. Code 13 will be
assigned to those who have obtained degree or diploma or certificate
in general or technical education which is equivalent to
post-graduation level and above.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the literacy campaigns, in the 1980s, instruments were designed to
measure levels of literacy by asking people to actually read specified
text. This is not done either in Census or in NSSO surveys. Among
recent large-scale surveys, such tools for measurement of learning
achievements were used in <a href="http://www.asercentre.org/">ASER surveys</a>. Rukmini S. has three useful
articles in The Hindu discussing data on learning achievements
\cite{rukmini210114,rukmini020214,rukmini030214}.

<h2 id="org42caa78">School attendance</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org42caa78">
<p>
Rawal (2011) discusses problems of official statistics on school
attendance.\cite{vikaseducation2011} Main conclusion on this issue is
summarised in the paper as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Official statistics on school education have been extremely
misleading, and some of the agencies involved in the collection of
these data have done great disservice to the cause of universalisation
of school education by providing misleading statistics. Data on school
education in India are collected at the school level and the household
level. The data collected from schools, which form the basis for
official estimates of school enrolment, provide hugely inflated
estimates of the proportion of children regularly attending school.
Such statistics have been used to underplay the problem and to
underestimate the resources required to ensure free schooling for all
children (Ramachandran, Rawal, and Swaminathan 1997). Over-reporting
of school enrolment at initial levels of schooling results in
overestimation of drop-outs, when most of the children recorded as
drop-outs have actually never attended school. Such distortion of data
results in inappropriate policy formulation with little focus on
identifying out-of-school children and bringing them to school.
</p>

<p>
Another important limitation of the school-based statistics is that
they cannot be used to separately study the access of rural children
to schooling. Since a substantial number of rural children attend
schools located in urban areas, rates of school attendance among them
must be measured through household surveys and not through
school-based statistics.
</p>

<p>
In view of the above, it is clear that household survey-based data
from the Censuses of India and NSSO surveys should form the basis for
official estimates of rates of school attendance and the number of
out-of-school children.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4116a8b">
<p>
Main sources of data on schooling infrastructure and teachers are 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
The All India School Education Survey (AISES), conducted by the
National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT).
</p>

<p>
This survey has been conducted in 1957, 1965, 1973, 1978, 1986,
1998, 2002, and 2009. Detailed data at the level of individual
schools are available from the sixth (1998) and seventh (2002)
surveys. The results of the eighth round of AISES, conducted in
2009, are not yet available.
</p></li>

<li><p>
The District Information System for Education (DISE), developed and
maintained by the National University of Educational Planning and
Administration (NUEPA).
</p>

<p>
DISE was initiated in 1995â€“96 for monitoring evaluation of the
District Primary Education Programme (DPEP) and was later
integrated with the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) as a monitoring
tool. It was implemented in 42 districts to begin with and then
extended, in stages, to cover all the districts of the country. A
large amount of information collected as a part of DISE is made
available at the level of individual schools, as well as in
aggregated form at the district, State and national levels.
