Ramakumar and Chavan (2011)\cite{ramakumar2011} have pointed out that
the branches are classified as rural, semi-urban, urban and
metropolitan on the basis of census data. This classification changes
over time as RBI moves from one round of Census to the next. As a
result, a branch classified as rural in one year may be classified as
semi-urban in subsequent years. This needs to be taken into account
while analysing data on trends in number of rural bank branches.
