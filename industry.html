The CAS Programme of the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning, JNU
has supported an initiative to produce Free and Open-source scripts to
read ASI unit-level data and produce annotated databases out of them.
The programmes are released under GNU GPL license. We are hosting
these programmes for use by anyone who may be interested.
