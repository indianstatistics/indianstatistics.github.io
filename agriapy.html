Data on area, production and yield of crops are provided by the
Ministry of Agriculture. We are providing here district-level data
taken from the Ministry. The files taken from the Ministry have been
cleaned up only in respect of creating neatly defined columns of data
corresponding to different variables.
</p>

<p>
Data on crop yields primarily come from crop-cutting surveys. See
<a href="http://mospi.nic.in/Mospi_New/upload/as_4.html#_Toc506710762">Section 4.3</a> of the report for a discussion of statistics on crop
production.
</p>

<p>
Data on area under different crops come from plot-by-plot records
maintained by village-level revenue official (patwari) in former
temporary-settlement areas. In former permanent settlement areas (West
Bengal, Orissa and Bihar), they are based on sample surveys since
plot-by-plot records are not maintained. In north-eastern States, data
on crop areas are based on ad-hoc estimates made by the village-level
officials. See <a href="http://mospi.nic.in/Mospi_New/upload/as_4.html#_Toc506710753">Section 4.2</a> of the Rangarajan Commission report for a
discussion of statistics on crop areas.
