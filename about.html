<p>
This website is created and maintained by the Society for Social and
Economic Research, New Delhi.
</p>

<p>
A lot of statistics on Indian economy and society are available
online. These are scattered across various websites and are mostly
provided without any information on the sources, data definitions and
limitations of these statistics. 
</p>

<p>
This website was conceived as a platform to host statistics on
different aspects of the economy and society. The website aims to
differentiate itself from other sources on following counts:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://www.indianstatistics.org">indianstatistics.org</a> will combine dissemination of data with
documentation about the data and critical analysis of problems
related to the use of these statistics. The website will provide
references, and where possible, online links, to scholarly analyses
about these data and analyses based on these data.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.indianstatistics.org">indianstatistics.org</a> will build an archive of documents related to
the statistical system of India.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.indianstatistics.org">indianstatistics.org</a> will also build an archive of important
non-official data and documents related to Indian economy and
society.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.indianstatistics.org">indianstatistics.org</a> will acknowledge accurately all original
sources of data and documents hosted on the website.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.indianstatistics.org">indianstatistics.org</a> will only host data and documents that are
publicly available, or data and documents for which the provider has
specifically authorised indianstatistics.org to disseminate data.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.indianstatistics.org">indianstatistics.org</a> will provide all data and documents free of
cost.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.indianstatistics.org">indianstatistics.org</a> will also provide links to external sources of
data. However, in such cases, the accuracy of data, the format in
which these data are provided and the issues of copyright are not a
responsibility of <a href="http://www.indianstatistics.org">indianstatistics.org</a></li>

<p>
The website is created using <a href="http://www.orgmode.org">orgmode</a> and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. The scripts behind
this website read data from offline databases maintained by the
administrator, and create the html using <a href="http://www.orgmode.org">orgmode</a> and <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> code embedded
in org files. Rest of the magic is done by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. References are
maintained in a bibtex database and are integrated with the website
using <a href="http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/bibtex2html/">bibtex2html</a> and <a href="http://www.orgmode.org/">orgmode</a>. We would like to acknowledge and thank
the communities of developers behind all these projects.
