Various issues in respect of price statistics in India have been
discussed in the <a href="http://mospi.nic.in/Mospi_New/upload/ps_11.html">Chapter 11</a> of the Report of the Rangarajan
Commission. For a discussion of historical evolution of price
statistics, see Sivasubramonian (1961)\cite{sivasubramonian1961},
Pandit (2000)\cite{pandit2000}, Pandit (2001)\cite{panditprice2001}.

Over the last four decades, three committees were constituted by the
Ministry of Labour to look at various methodological issues in respect
of consumer price indices. These were: the Nilakantha Rath Committee
(1978)\cite{cpicommittee1978}, the K. C. Seal Committee
(1981)\cite{cpicommittee1981} and the G. K. Chaddha Committee
(2009)\cite{cpicommittee2009}. Interestingly, terms of reference for
all these committees covered only the CPIIW, and none of them examined
methodological issues pertaining to CPIs for Agricultural and Rural
Labour.

<p>
Data for the CPIAL and the CPIRL are collected by the NSSO for the
Labour Bureau. Labour Bureau computes the price indices based on the
data provided by the NSSO. These are published in the Indian Labour
Journal and in various other publications.
</p>

<p>
The Labour Bureau started releasing data for the CPIAL series, with
base year 1950-51, from 1958.  The series with base year 1960-61 was
started in 1964. From November 1995, the Labour Bureau started
releasing data for a new series using 1986-87 as the base year.
</p>

<p>
Following two methodological issues are of note in respect of the
present series.
</p>

<p>
First, the basket of commodities, and the weights assigned to each
commodity, for which prices are collected in the present series are
outdated. Deaton (2008) \cite{deatonprice2008} pointed out that the
weights used in the CPIAL and CPIIW do not reflect changes in
consumption baskets as these weights are not updated frequently
enough. Using an analysis of 1999-2000 and 2004-05 NSSO data, Deaton
pointed out that the CPIAL understated inflation because of excessive
weight being given to cereal consumption (and to food consumption as a
whole) in CPIAL in a period in which food prices fell relative to
non-food prices. In the same way, although to a smaller degree, CPIIW
also understated inflation during this period.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, the sample size of the survey is just about 600 villages,
and price quotations received for any commodity are far fewer.  (see
<a href="http://mospi.nic.in/Mospi_New/upload/RPC_July_Sep2012.pdf">http://mospi.nic.in/Mospi_New/upload/RPC_July_Sep2012.pdf</a> and

Yoshifumi Usami has compiled the State-wise monthly CPIAL data for
1969-70 to 1995-96 (base-year 1960) and for 1995-96 to 2013-14
(base-year 1986-87). He has kindly made these data available for
public use. The data series compiled by Yoshifumi Usami can be
