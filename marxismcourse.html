<p>
Organisation of the school emphasizes collective learning as well collective activity. It is mandatory for the participants to contribute to the coordination and organisation of the school. All day to day tasks of the school such as cleaning, kitchen work, laundry and so on are to be done by each participant in cooperation with others in the form of base groups and work groups. Combining class room learning with this form of collective work is at the core of the pedagogy of the course.
