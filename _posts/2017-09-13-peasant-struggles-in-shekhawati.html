<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge9a6d9f">
<p>
The Jagirdari system originated in Rajputana in the medieval period as a
system of military control and administration of the Rajput states. By
the early twentieth century, the Jagirdari system of Jaipur state, of
which Shekhawati was a part, had evolved into an extremely complex
system of land administration. Land was divided between <i>jagir</i> (or
<i>thikana</i>) and <i>khalsa</i> lands. <i>Jagirs</i> were awarded to Rajput military
chiefs, who administered it relatively autonomously, in return for
payment of revenue and provision of military services to Jaipur
state.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> Jaipur principality and big Jagirdars kept some land
directly under their control, on which they determined the rates of
revenue and collected it through their revenue collectors. These were
called the <i>khalsa</i> lands. Jaipur state had no <i>khalsa</i> land of its own
in Shekhawati and all land was in control of different Jagirdars. Big
Jagirdars like Rao Raja of Sikar had considerable <i>khalsa</i> land, on
which they determined rates of revenue, and <i>jagir</i> land, which was
in-turn awarded to smaller Jagirdars. Sub-infeudation was a fundamental
feature of the Jagirdari system in Jaipur state and it was common for
Jagirdars to award different parts of the <i>jagir</i> to smaller Jagirdars
(Stern, 1988). There were many categories of Jagirdars, with variations
in respect of the size of the land, on account of whether the award had
been made by the State or by a superior Jagirdar, and on account of
types of obligations towards the superior authority. There were several
categories of small Jagirdars &#x2013; at the bottom of the ladder were the
<i>bhumia</i> jagirdars &#x2013; who did not have any military capabilities and
merely provided revenue to the superior Jagirdars or to the Rajput crown
(Tod, 1920, Sisson, 1971, Stern, 1988 and Sharma, 1992). About half of
the land in Sikar was <i>Jagir</i> of Rao Raja of Sikar (that is, on this
land revenue was paid by peasants directly to Rao Raja) while the rest
was, in turn, awarded to smaller Jagirdars, who collected revenue from
peasants (Pande, 1982 and Ram, 1986). All <i>jagir</i> holders in Shekhawati
belonged to different clans of Rajput caste.
</p>

<p>
Sikar was the biggest <i>thikana</i> under Jaipur principality. It covered
about 3.7 lakh hectares (1455 square miles) of land and consisted 436
villages (Tod, 1920 and Ram, 1986). According to accounts provided by
James Tod for the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, Sikar Thikana accounted for
about 35 per cent of total revenue collected by Jaipur principality from
various <i>jagirs</i> (Tod, 1920). Land was cultivated by tenants-at-will who
could be alienated by the Jagirdars unilaterally and arbitrarily. Of
various peasant castes that worked as tenants, Jats were the most
numerous and cultivated the largest share of land. According to 1931
Census data, Jats accounted for 25.7 per cent of the population and
cultivated (as tenants) 56.7 per cent of the agricultural land in Sikar
<i>thikana.</i><sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
In the early twentieth century, conditions of peasants in Sikar
<i>thikana</i>, and in Jaipur state in general, were characterised by very
high burden of land revenue and other taxes imposed by the Jagirdars.
The rates of land revenue were determined arbitrarily and were changed
at will by the Jagirdars. Jaipur state and big Jagirdars usually
auctioned the right of revenue collection on their <i>khalsa</i> land to the
highest bidder. There were no definite laws regarding land revenue and
no official records were maintained. As explained by Sharma (1990 and
1992), under the prevalent practice, revenue officers of the <i>thikana,</i>
who were called <i>latara</i>, made a visual assessment (<i>kunt)</i> of the
standing crop of the peasants. The share of land revenue was determined
on the basis of this visual estimate. The rate of land revenue was
usually fixed as half of the estimated production but could be set at a
higher level arbitrarily. The visual estimate was typically considerably
higher than the actual production and available records suggest that, in
some cases, the land revenue even exceeded the actual production. Among
other reasons, rates of land revenue were increased beyond 50 per cent
to meet requirements of Jagirdars on accounts of wars, birth, deaths and
marriages in their families, and for coronation ceremonies of
inheritors.
</p>

<p>
Not only were peasants charged very high land revenue, they also had to
pay a very large number of other taxes (<i>lag</i>), which together were even
higher in value than the land revenue. Taxes were imposed for keeping
animals, for using natural resources like firewood from trees, for using
water for animals and irrigation, and for use of pastures and wild
bushes. Taxes (<i>zakat</i>) were imposed on goods transported from one
village to another and from one <i>thikana</i> to another. In addition,
peasants also had to provide various kinds of unpaid labour services
(<i>bag</i>) as well as meet other demands (for example, providing camels to
Jagirdars). Peasant castes, including Jats, were subject to various
civic restrictions: for example, they were not allowed to wear gold
ornaments, ride horses and elephants, and in some cases, not even
allowed to live in <i>pucca</i> houses (Sharma, 1990 and 1992).

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-peasant-struggles-in-shekhawati">
<p>
Major struggles of peasants against the Jagirdari system started in
Sikar in the 1920s. Historians of these peasant struggles have
identified several factors that inspired the Jat peasantry in Shekawati
to struggle against Jagirdari oppression. Arya Samaj, which had
considerable influence among the Jat peasantry, was instrumental in
motivating peasants to oppose excesses of Jagirdars (Ram, 1986). Peasant
movements elsewhere in Rajasthan, most notably the Bijolia peasant
struggle, and other contemporary peasant struggles in the country, were
also directly influential (Ram, 1986, Pande, 1986 and Sharma
1990).<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> Jats in areas under the control of the British had acquired
considerable political and economic power. Jat leaders from these areas
were actively involved in organising Jats in Shekhawati to protest
against excesses of Rajput Jagirdars (Stern, 1988 and Sharma, 1992).
Sharma (1992) notes the influence of international developments, in
particular of peasants from Shekhawati who joined the British army and
participated in the First World War, and of the Russian revolution on
leaders of Bijolia and Shekhawati peasant struggles.
</p>

<p>
Peasant struggles in Shekhwati originated in 1922 as protests against
arbitrary increases in demands of land revenue by the Rao Raja
(<i>thikanedar</i>) of Sikar in a year that had seen widespread draught and
crop failures in Sikar.
</p>

<p>
Sharma (1992) has identified three phases in the peasant struggles in
Shekhawati between 1920s and 1950s, when the Jagirdari system was
abolished.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc1a8439" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="phase-i-struggles-between-1922-and-1930">Phase I: Struggles between 1922 and 1930</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-phase-i-struggles-between-1922-and-1930">
<p>
The first phase, from 1922 to about 1930, was of incipient attempts to
demand relief against excesses of the Jagirdars, in particular, Rao Raja
of Sikar. During this phase, representatives of peasants took advantage
of contradictions between the Jagirdars and the Jaipur state, which was
then directly under British administration, and appealed to the Jaipur
state and British authorities against excesses of Rao Raja.
Establishment of Shekhawati Jat Sabha in 1925, as an arm of the
All-India Jat Mahasabha, provided the organisational basis for the
peasant movements in this phase.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> Major success of the peasant
movement in this phase was the reversal of increases in land revenue as
a result of interventions by the Jaipur state. This was a major
achievement, which encouraged peasants to further intensify their
struggles. It is also noteworthy since, as a result of struggles of
peasants, Jaipur state was forced to intervene in matters that were
until then considered an autonomous domain of the Jagirdars. However,
these achievements only provided them temporary relief, and larger
demands of peasants &#x2013; in respect of abolition of labour services,
regulation of other taxes, in respect of their civic rights, and for
improvements of facilities for health and education &#x2013; remained unmet.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="phase-ii-1930-through-1938">Phase II: 1930 through 1938</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-phase-ii-1930-through-1938">
<p>
According to Sharma (1992), the second phase, from 1930 through 1938,
was a period of organisational consolidation of the Shekhawati Peasant
Movement. Kisan Jat Panchayats and Kisan Sabhas were organised during
these period. Shekhawati Kisan Sabha, headed by Tarkeshwar Sharma, was
formed with the support of Socialists within the Congress. During this
phase of the Shekhawati peasant movement, lines of struggles were more
sharply drawn between Jat tenants and Jagirdars. A number of violent
incidents took place between Jat peasants and Rajput Jagirdars, and the
strength of peasants grew (Sisson 1971 and Sharma 1992). In August 1934,
under pressure from the British, the Rao Raja of Sikar agreed to a
number of demands of the peasants including waiver of taxes, permission
to use pasture land for grazing, and abolition of <i>bag</i> (unpaid labour
services). However, the agreement was not implemented and peasants
further intensified their struggle.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8bde666" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="phase-iii-1938-through-1940s">Phase III: 1938 through 1940s</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-phase-iii-1938-through-1940s">
<p>
The third phase, from 1938 until end of 1940s, was a period in which the
Indian National Congress, through the Jaipur State Praja Mandal, became
involved in issues of peasantry in Shekhawati. Involvement, and coming
to dominance, of Praja Mandal critically determined the future course of
the peasant movement and eventual abolition of Jagirdari system in early
1950s. Until 1938, the Congress leadership had been indifferent, and had
openly dissociated itself, from peasant struggles in Rajasthan. Praja
Mandal, which was re-established in 1938, was primarily urban-based, and
was led by rich marwari bania community and brahmans.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> While Praja
Mandal leadership realised the importance of co-opting a mature peasant
movement of Shekhawati for expanding political influence of Praja Mandal
in the region, sections of Kisan Panchayats and Kisan Sabhas were
opposed to the peasant movement becoming a part of the Praja Mandals
(Sisson, 1971 and Pande, 1982). The Shekhawati Kisan Sabha continued to
function independently and organised Kisan Sabhas in Shekhawati. In
1938-39, Kisan Sabhas faced repression from the Jaipur State, and most
of its leaders were either imprisoned or were forced to leave the State
(Pande, 1982).
</p>

<p>
In 1938, the Jaipur State forcibly took over administration of Sikar
<i>thikana</i> and sent Rao Raja Kalyan Singh into exile. Following this,
land settlement was done in the <i>khalsa</i> lands that were earlier under
direct administration of Rao Raja. However, despite a considerable
decline in powers of smaller Jagirdars, Jaipur state and the British
could not implement land settlement in <i>jagir</i> areas. In this phase,
initially, both the Jaipur state and <i>thikanedars</i> tried to get support
of the peasants by offering them concessions. However, with
intensification of the Quit India movement, the peasant movement came
under a broad leadership of Praja Mandal, and Jaipur state and the
British tried to repress the movement (Sharma, 1992).
</p>

<p>
It is clear that peasant struggles in Shekhawati had been led throughout
the three phases by peasants belonging to Jat caste. Caste organisations
of Jats &#x2013; Shekhawati Jat Sabha in the 1920s, and Shekhawati Jat Kisan
Panchayat &#x2013; were at the forefront of these struggues through the 1930s
and 1940s. Although not organised as Jats, and not as large a group
numerically, Brahmans were an ally of Jats in these struggles. Although
Brahman enjoyed a high caste and social position, they were economically
poor. A number of leaders in the movement, of whom the most prominent
was Tarakeshwar Sharma, came from Brahman caste.
</p>

<p>
Marwari trader community, although wealthy, had no political position in
the Jaipur state and did not have civic rights comparable to the ruling
Rajputs. They had been influenced by the Congress, and had organised
non-cooperation and <i>swadeshi</i> movements in Shekhawati since 1921. While
Marwari traders-cum-moneylenders were themselves a parasitic class, and
Jat peasants were wary of them, Marwari community tacitly supported
struggles against Rajput Jagirdars by providing funds and by
facilitating contacts with the British (Sharma, 1990).
</p>

<p>
There had been a few attempts at organising joint struggles of peasants
from other castes but these were not successful. In late 1920s, leaders
of All India Jat Mahasbha formed Ahir Jat Gujjar and Rajput Sabha in
order to bring all peasant castes together. However, Jats of Shekhawati
left this organisation in 1929 to organise their movement separately.
There was an uprising of <i>Bairwa</i> (Chamar) peasants in Unaira <i>thikana</i>
in 1946. All India State People Bairwa Mahasabha provided leadership to
an independent movement of Bairwa peasants in Unaira between 1946 and
1949, a period in which <i>Jat</i> peasant movements had merged into Praja
Mandal (Sharma, 1990). Sisson (1966) notes that there was some
participation of <i>Sirvi</i> and <i>Vishnoi</i> untouchable castes in Kisan
Sabhas in Shekhawati in late 1940s.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-abolition-of-jagirdari-system-and-emergence-of-a-new-land-structure">
<p>
The most important legislation for abolition of the Jagirdari System, the Rajasthan Land Reforms and Resumption of Jagir Act, was adopted in 1952. Iyer (1995) has provided a summary of legislative process of abolition of Jagirdari System in Rajasthan. As of December 16, 1957, government resumed all rights on <i>jagir</i> lands. However, <i>khalsa</i> lands, orchards, non-agricultural lands, wells and buildings continued to belong to the Jagirdards. Jagirdars were given a compensation equivalent to seven times the net income from land, which was assessed at 30 per cent of the value of produce (Rudolph and Rudolph, 2011). On erstwhile <i>jagir</i> lands, ownership (<i>khatedari</i>) rights were provided to those who were until then recognised only as tenants. In Rajasthan as a whole, a total of 200 lakh hectares of <i>jagir</i> land were resumed under Jagirdari Abolition acts (Iyer, 1995). Given the strength of peasant movement in Sikar, Jagirdari Abolition Act was implemented very successfully in Sikar.
</p>

<p>
According to the account provided by Rudolph and Rudolph (2011), big
Jagirdars of Rajasthan, who had substantial <i>khalsa</i> lands that were
exempted from resumption under the Jagirdari Abolition Act, formed an
association, the Kshatriya Mahasabha, and negotiated through legal and
political means for higher compensation for the <i>jagir</i> lands. On the
other hand, most small Jagirdars had no <i>khalsa</i> land. Between 1943 and
1946, organisations of small Jagirdars demanded that a part of their
<i>jagir</i> land be treated as <i>khalsa</i> land (Ram, 1986)/./ In the 1950s,
small Jagirdars formed a separate association, Bhuswami Sangh, to
struggle for an exemption of small <i>Jagirs</i> from resumption under the
Act.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup> However, as a result of strong political strength of the Jat
peasantry by now, Bhuswami Sangh, did not succeed in getting its demands
accepted despite violent struggles in the early 1950s (Rudolph and
Rudolph, 2011). In Shekhawati, where all land was classified as <i>jagir</i>
land, this had major implications.
</p>

<p>
Large Rajput Jagirdars in other parts of Rajasthan obtained substantial
compensation on account of resumption of <i>jagirs</i> and had the <i>khalsa</i>
land left for themselves. These families joined the Congress party and
continued to wield considerable social and political power in Rajasthan
(Rudolph and Rudolph, 2011).
</p>

<p>
In contrast, given that almost all land in Sikar was classified as
<i>jagir</i> land, Jagirdars of Sikar lost most of their land and were
impoverished. On the other hand, tenant peasants, who had faced worst
forms of social oppression at the hands of Rajput Jagirdars, came to get
ownership (<i>khatedari</i>) rights over land that they had cultivated as
tenants. Of all the various castes, Jats had been the biggest tenants
and were most organised. They were, thus, the biggest beneficiaries of
Jagirdari abolition. In this process, Jagirdari abolition clearly turned
upside down the relative economic positions of Jat peasants and Rajputs.
In this respect, the experience of Jagirdari abolition in Sikar was
unique.
</p>

<p>
As in most of India, implementation of land ceilings and land
redistribution were not implemented seriously in Rajasthan. Land reform
laws were marred by serious loopholes, which were used by large
landowners to evade ceilings (Iyer, 1996b). Land ceilings were
introduced in Rajasthan in 1960 through a provision of the Rajasthan
Tenancy Act, 1955.<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup> Given a vast variation in quality of land in
Rajasthan, the ceilings defined under Rajasthan Tenancy Act ranged from
22 acres to 336 acres per family (Government of India, 1966). These
ceilings could be relaxed for families having more than five members
(Iyer, 1995). There was a gap of three years between enactment of
provision of land ceiling and formulation of rules (Government of India,
1966). Such a prolonged delay only helped in concealing ceiling surplus
land through <i>benami</i> transfers. Given a vast variation in applicable
ceilings, various kinds of relaxations that were allowed, and lack of
political support for implementation of the programme, very little
progress was made in implementation of land ceiling. Using data for
1970-71, Bandyopadhyay (1986) estimated ceiling surplus land in
Rajasthan to be about 40 lakh hectares. In contrast, until 2007, only
about 2.3 lakh hectares of ceiling surplus land have been taken
possession of (Government of India, 2008). This was only about 1 per
cent of cultivable land in the State. Tenancy laws in Rajasthan do not
restrict leasing of land and merely specify statutory rates of rent that
can be charged. Even these provisions for regulating terms of tenancy
are applicable to only those tenants and sub-tenants who have a
legally-valid contract between the lessor and the lessee (Srinivas,
1995). This obviously excludes a vast majority of tenancy contracts that
remain informal and oral.
</p>

<p>
Historical evidence reviewed here shows that the emergence of
economically and politically dominant landlords from among Jat, and to a
smaller extent Brahmin, castes in Shekhawati is a relatively recent
phenomenon. Peasant struggles in Shekhawati in the first half of the twentieth century
brought an end to the shackles of the Jagirdari system. Jagirdari
Abolition brought about a fundamental change in structure of control
over land in Shekhawati with tenants-at-will getting ownership rights
over land.
