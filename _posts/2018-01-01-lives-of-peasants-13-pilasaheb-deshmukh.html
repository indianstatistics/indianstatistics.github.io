<p>
Pilasaheb S. Deshmukh (PSD), a sugarcane farmer from prosperous southern Maharashtra. PSD has 7.5 acres of land irrigated by a cooperative minor lift irrigation project. PSD had problems in selling each of the three crops he harvested in 2017. While the ratoon sugarcane crop harvested in January fetched him a good return, he was unable to use any of the money for two months because of demonetisation. The soybean crop he harvested in July could not be sold because of a crash of prices. The planted crop of sugarcane that matured in October 2017 was not harvested until the end of December because of delayed operations of the sugar mill.

<p>
Kolhapur district in Southern Maharashtra is a prosperous rural region
of the state. Sugarcane is the most important crop grown here.
Maharashtra accounts for about 20 per cent of national production of
sugarcane. Of this, about 40 per cent comes from the Kolhapur
sub-division. The region has a large number of sugar mills. Although
most of these sugar mills are cooperatives of farmers, they are
controlled by a few politically powerful and economically wealthy sugar
barons. Historically, sugar barons from this region, with their large
irrigated landholdings and control over sugar mills, have wielded
considerable political power in Maharashtra.
</p>

<p>
While southern Maharashtra is known for its prosperity, it is also a
region with high economic inequalities. Rich capitalist farmers and
sugar barons have benefited greatly from the growth of the sugar economy
since the 1970s. On the other hand, a vast majority of poor and middle
peasants struggle to negotiate a complex production and contracting
system. Delays in harvesting and lifting the contracted cane and delays
in payment by sugar mills have been persistent problems for sugarcane
farmers in Maharashtra. More recently, demonetisation dealt a
particularly severe blow to farmers growing commercial crops like
sugarcane. This account of farming by Pilasaheb Sitaram Deshmukh&rsquo;s
household shows that, even in a prosperous region such as Kolhapur, an
average peasant struggled to make his ends meet.
</p>

<p>
Pilasaheb Sitaram Deshmukh has a large joint family comprising a total
of 8 members. The household has 7.5 acres of land located near the
confluence of the Panchganga and Krishna rivers. The land is irrigated
by a cooperative minor lift irrigation project called Shri Dutt Pani
Parvota. The 40-year old irrigation system pumps water from the
Panchganga river and irrigates about 40 acres of land belonging to 15
households.
</p>

<p>
About 2.5 acres of Deshmukh&rsquo;s land is low lying and is flooded by the
river for half of the year. For the rest of the year, fodder crops are
grown on this land for the three buffaloes that his household owns.
</p>

<p>
Deshmukh&rsquo;s household has two other plots of land, one of 2 acres and
another of 3 acres, both of which are used for growing sugarcane. On
both the plots, sugarcane cultivation follows a crop rotation cycle of
three years comprising a planted crop of sugarcane (which is
intercropped with groundnut or soybean) followed by a ratoon crop of
sugarcane. Although both the plots have a three-year cropping cycle,
sugarcane is planted on these plots in different years. Planting
sugarcane in different years staggers the investment requirements and
reduces the amount of labour that needs to be mobilised in any year. The
planted crops and the ratoon crops mature in different months. With
staggered planting, a part of the sugarcane is harvested in
November-December and the rest in January-February. This ensures
smoother delivery of sugarcane to mills. In Maharashtra, sugarcane is
harvested as per a schedule drawn by each sugar mill for the planted
crop and for the ratoon crop. Harvesting, for which peasants are charged
by the mill, is done by labour gangs contracted by each sugar mill.
</p>

<p>
Deshmukh&rsquo;s household started a fresh cropping cycle on the 3-acre plot
in 2016. It started with thoroughly tilling the soil, application of
farm yard manure and fertilisers, and creation of ridges and furrows on
the plot. In June 2016, groundnut was sown on the ridges. A month and a
half later, in August 2016, sugarcane setts (sugarcane cuttings) were
planted in the furrows. Groundnut was harvested in November 2016, while
sugarcane plants were still very small. The focus then shifted to
sugarcane. As the canes grew, earth from the ridges was hoed and pressed
around the sugarcane plants to support them. During this period of plant
growth, the field was repeatedly irrigated, fertiliser and plant
protection chemicals were applied, and weeds were removed. Eventually,
as the canes grew to their full length, they were tied together in
bunches to further prevent lodging. The canes were ready for harvest by
about October, 2017. However, until the time of writing this account, at
the end of December 2017, his planted crop of sugarcane had not been
harvested. The sugar mill started its operations a month later than
usual and Deshmukh&rsquo;s turn for harvesting had not yet come. Delay in
delivery of sugarcane meant that about Rs. 1.6 lakhs of paid out
expenditure he had incurred on the crop remained locked. He was unable
to repay the Rs. 2.5 lakh crop loan he had taken. Moreover, he had to
further invest in irrigation and maintenance of the crop until his turn
came to deliver the cane.
</p>

<p>
A similar three-year cycle was started in 2014 on the 2-acre plot. After
harvesting the planted crop around December 2015, a ratoon crop of
sugarcane was allowed to grow. Since the cost of production of the
ratoon crop is lower than the planted crop &#x2013; Deshmukh incurred a paid
out expenditure of about Rs. 80,000 for 2-acres of the ratoon crop &#x2013;
farmers get a good return from the crop. The ratoon crop of 80 tonnes
sugarcane was harvested in January 2017 and sold for Rs. 2.4 lakhs.
However, because of demonetisation, he was unable to withdraw any money
for two months after the sale. Although the input dealer he usually
bought fertilisers from provided inputs on credit in the past, he
stopped doing so in the months following demonetisation because he was
not receiving repayments of earlier advances from farmers. Despite
having Rs. 2.4 lakhs proceeds from the sale of his ratoon crop in his
bank account, Deshmukh had to borrow Rs. 20,000 from his relatives to
buy fertilisers and pay wages to workers.
</p>

<p>
After harvesting the ratoon crop and before the new cropping cycle would
start, the land was left fallow for four months. During this period,
they applied manure, ploughed the land and made it ready for
cultivation. This time, Deshmukh&rsquo;s household chose to plant soybean on
the ridges as the market prices of soybean had been very high (Rs. 3300
per quintal) in the previous year (2016). Soybean was sown on the ridges
in May 2017, followed by planting of sugarcane setts in July in the
furrows. In July 2017, they harvested 11 quintals of soybean. However,
this year the prices of soybean fell to about Rs. 2500 per quintal. As a
result, until December 2017, five months after the crop had been
harvested, the household had been unable to sell their soybean.
</p>

<p>
In other words, even a farmer like Pilasaheb Sitaram Deshmukh, with 7.5
acres of irrigated land in prosperous Kolhapur district, faced serious
problems in selling each of the three crops he harvested in 2017. While
the ratoon sugarcane crop harvested in January fetched him a good
return, he was unable to use any of the money for two months because of
demonetisation. The soybean crop he harvested in July could not be sold
because of a crash of prices. The planted crop of sugarcane that matured
in October was not harvested until the end of December because of
delayed operations of the sugar mill.
