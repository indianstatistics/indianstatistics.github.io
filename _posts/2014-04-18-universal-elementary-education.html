The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009
promises free and compulsory education to all children in the age
group of 6-14 years. But the way this critical entitlement is being
implemented leaves much to be desired. Apart from there being glaring
gaps in the provisions of the Act, its implementation challenges have
plagued the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the programme that is aimed at
ushering in quality elementary education for all. The problems are
many, and this paper observes that most of them can be connected to
inadequate funds. It concludes that the best way of ensuring that the
Act&rsquo;s aims are fulfilled is to bring in a common school system based
on neighbourhood schools that replaces the bewildering variety of
indifferent institutions we now have.
