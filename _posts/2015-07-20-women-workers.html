<p>
This paper is a contribution towards understanding reasons behind
declining female employment in India as indicated by recent rounds of
large-sample Employment and Unemployment Surveys conducted by the
National Sample Survey (NSS) Organisation.
</p>

<p>
Following points emerge from the analysis presented in the paper.
</p>

<p>
There was a sharp decline in female workforce participation rate from
41 per cent in 1999-2000 to 32 per cent in 2011-12. This decline was
sharper in rural areas (from 48 per cent in 1999-2000 to 37 per cent
in 2011-12), and can be primarily attributed to massive contraction of
employment opportunities in agriculture, which was not compensated by
rising employment opportunities in rural non-farm sector. In contrast,
among men, decline in the availability of employment in agriculture
was compensated in part by the expansion of employment in
construction. Looking at rural and urban areas together, employment
for men declined by 11 percentage points in agriculture and increased
by about 6 percentage points in construction between 1999-2000 and
2011-12.
</p>

<p>
The paper identifies three important factors that are likely to have
contributed to a decline in the levels of employment of women.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Proportion of households that did not have any land to cultivate
increased from about 41 per cent in 1999-2000 to about 49 per cent
in 2011-12. Women are primarily employed in agriculture. Decline
in proportion of households that cultivated land directed resulted
in a decline in proportion of women who were self-employed in
agriculture. With a clear cost advantage in mechanisation over use
of animals for draught power, there has been an increasing
adoption of labour displacing technology in agriculture. Increased
concentration of operational holdings is also likely to have
contributed to a greater adoption of labour displacing
technologies in agriculture as large cultivators deploy labour
displacing technology to a greater extent. Adoption of labour
displacing technology results in a decline in overall labour
absorption in agriculture.</li>

<li>Lack of access to basic amenities and serious problems of safety
for women impede physical mobility of women. Very few rural women
migrate or commute to urban areas to take advantage of whatever
non-agricultural employment is available in the towns and
cities. Proportion of rural women who did some work in urban areas
is minuscule, and increased only marginally from about 0.22 per
cent in 1999-2000 to only about 0.46 per cent in 2011-12. Although
small in magnitude, the direction of change in the proportion of
urban women working in rural areas is noteworthy. Mainly driven by
a small increase in absorption of women in manufacturing
enterprises located in rural areas, the proportion of urban women
doing some work in rural areas increased from 2.57 per cent in
1999-2000 to 4.02 per cent in 2011-12.</li>

<li>Finally, with dismal levels of education and technical training,
women are marginalised from the limited opportunities for more
remunerative skilled work. In 2011-12, only 0.66 per cent of rural
working-age women workers and only 7.6 per cent of urban
working-age women workers had received secondary-level education
and some technical training. Even among women employed in
education and health care services, a vast majority did not have
secondary-level education and technical training.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As per the UN System of National Accounts, persons engaged in
activities that result in production of different commodities for
household use should be considered a part of the labour
force. However, in the NSSO Surveys of Employment and Unemployment,
women engaged only in housework are considered out of labour force
even if the housework involves regular participation in activities for
producing/acquiring food, fuel, fodder, clothing and other
commodities. With contraction of employment opportunities for women,
proportion of rural working-age women who were principally engaged in
housework increased from about 55 per cent in 1999-2000 to about 62
per cent in 2011-12. A substantial proportion of women who were
reported to be principally engaged in housework were also engaged in
activities for obtaining different commodities for household use in
addition to doing care-work for the household. This was particularly
important for rural women. In 2011-12, about 58 per cent of rural
working-age houseworker women regularly worked to obtain fuel or
fodder for household use. Similarly, about 45 per cent of rural
houseworker women regularly worked to obtain food for the
household. Abour 31 per cent of rural houseworkers had to regularly
fetch water from outside, and about 30 per cent had to regularly work
to prepare clothing for household use. Among urban working-age women
who were principally engaged in housework, about 25 per cent worked to
make clothing for household use, and about 13 per cent worked to
obtain food for household use.
</p>

<p>
We argue that women engaged in these specified activities for home use
should be considered a part of the labour force. We show that by doing
this, the size of labour force in the age group 15 to 59 years
increases by 28 per cent. Further, we argue that, because these
activities are unremunerated and minimally productive, women engaged
in only these activities other than care-work for their own households
should be treated as unemployed. By accounting for this, the paper
shows that, in 2011-12, the open unemployment rate among working age
persons was 23.8 per cent. Unemployment rates were particularly high
among women and had increased from about 47 per cent in 1999-2000 to
over 51 per cent in 2011-12.
