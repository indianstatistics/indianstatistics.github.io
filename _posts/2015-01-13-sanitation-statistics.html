<p>
Here is a very interesting paper. Arjun
Kumar\cite{arjun_sanitation_2014} shows that, according to official
reports, 78.27 million individual household latrines were constructed
under the Total Sanitation Campaign (renamed as Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan
in 2012) between 2001-02 and 2010-11. However, according to the Census
of India, over the same period, number of households having latrine
within premises increased by only 21.2 million.
</p>

<p>
Kumar shows that the Census data on proportion of households having
toilets within premises are broadly consistent with other
household-level statistics. As per the 2011 Census, about 31 per cent
of households had latrines within premises of their
homesteads/houses. In comparison, NSSO&rsquo;s 2012 survey on &ldquo;Drinking
Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Housing Condition in India&rdquo; put the
proportion at 41 per cent.
</p>

<p>
The increase in number of households having toilets in their houses
seen in the Census data refers to all households having toilets, and
not merely households that built toilets under the Total Sanitation
Campaign. Since under the Total Sanitation Campaign toilets are
constructed only for the below poverty line households and SC/ST
households among non-poor, surely a substantial number of non-poor
households that built toilets during this period would have built them
on their own. This implies that the actual discrepancy between the
claims and the reality of toilets built under the Total Sanitation
Campaign/Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan is likely to be even greater.
</p>

<p>
It would have been interesting if the paper also provided State-level
statistics on this discrepancy. In which States is this discrepancy
particularly high?
</p>

<p>
These results are not merely about discrepancy in statistics on
sanitation, as Kumar argues. They actually raise questions about
veracity of claims made about the work done under the flagship
programme of the Indian government in the area of sanitation. A vast
number of toilets build under the Total Sanitation Programme/Nirmal
Bharat Abhiyan do not seem to exist. Were they ever built or was the
money just siphoned off?
