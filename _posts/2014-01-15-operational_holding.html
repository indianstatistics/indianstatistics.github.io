This paper analyses National Sample survey data on changes in the
distribution of operational holdings of land, using data from NSS
surveys on employment and unemployment. The paper discusses the
limitations of these statistics in some detail. Four main points
emerge from the analysis: there has been a sharp rise in landlessness
in rural India; caste disparities in access to land have persisted
over time; there has been a rise in inequality in distribution of land
cultivated by households; and there has been a decline in the
proportion of manual labour households that combined wage labour with
cultivation of small holdings. Finally, statistics on land
distribution at the State level reveal some puzzling features â€“ some
of which point to possible errors in data collection.
