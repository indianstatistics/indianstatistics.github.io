<p>
Aandavar, a farmer from drought-hit Ariyalur district of Tamil Nadu, is drowning in debt and last year&rsquo;s drought has worsened the situation of his family. They have a formal-sector agricultural loan of Rs. 2.50 lakhs from 2010. In 2015, they mortgaged jewellery to a cooperative society and took a loan of Rs. 1.35 lakh. In 2017, they took another loan of Rs.1.25 lakh to meet their consumption expenses. They have already sold 2 acres of farmland in the last 7 years to pay off the loans partially.

<p>
During the <i>Kisan Mukti Sansad</i> held on 20-21 November in Delhi, we
interviewed Aandavar, a paddy farmer from Karaiyevetti village, Ariyalur
district in Tamil Nadu, to delve deeper into the impact of recurrent
droughts on his household.
</p>

<p>
Aandavar is 46-years old. Although he has done a Diploma in
Communication Engineering, he has never been able to find a job as an
engineer. Cultivating five acres of household land and looking after
cattle is his main occupation. Aandavar&rsquo;s household is a joint-family
comprising nine members. He has two brothers: Manivannan, who is
employed as a forest watcher at the Karaivetti Bird Sanctuary, and
Sundaran, who occasionally works as a caterer. Aandavar is a widower and
has two children, both of whom are studying in school. Aandavar, his
mother Govindammal and his sister-in-law Poomaala regularly work on
their land. His brothers also work in the fields occasionally.
</p>

<p>
Ariyalur district is located in the Cauvery delta, in the foothills of
the Eastern Ghats. Majority of the district&rsquo;s population is engaged in
agriculture and related activities. As per the 2014-15 crop statistics
of the district, paddy accounts for 20 per cent of the district&rsquo;s gross
cropped area. Other major crops include cashews, cotton, maize,
sugarcane, pulses and groundnut. Ariyalur farmers depend on canals,
tanks and their own tubewells for irrigation.
</p>

<p>
Karaiyavetti village, from where Aandavar hails, is located about 35 km
from Ariyalur district headquarters. According to the 2011 Census,
Karaiyavetti with 793 households had a total population of 3051, out of
which 1248 were cultivators and 496 were agricultural workers.
Agriculture in Karaiyavetti is mainly based on irrigation from the
Karaivetti Tank, which is one of the largest irrigation tanks of Tamil
Nadu. The Tank is fed by the Pullambadi canal during the northeast
monsoon (October-December) and also receives water from the Mettur dam
in Salem.
</p>

<p>
Navarai (January to April) is the main agricultural season in
Karaiyavetti during which a 120 day crop of paddy is grown. During the
season, the land preparation and sowing is done using tractor and hired
labour. After that, labour is hired for harvesting, threshing and
transporting grain to the market. All other tasks were done by members
of the household themselves. In the last Navarai season, hired male
workers were paid Rs. 600 per day. In contrast, the wages of female
workers were only Rs. 300 per day.
</p>

<p>
For rest of the year, i.e. for over 200 days, the land remains fallow.
Sometimes, depending on the availability of water, they also grow
sorghum after the paddy harvest. Low rainfall has been a problem in
Tamil Nadu for last two years, with 2016 recording the lowest ever
rainfall in the last 140 years.
</p>

<p>
A group of farmers from Tamil Nadu, spearheaded by National South Indian
River&rsquo;s Interlinking Farmer&rsquo;s Association (NSIRIFA), have been on an
indefinite protest in Delhi since June this year. Their list of demands
include a Rs. 40,000 crore drought relief package for Tamil Nadu, waiver
of farm loans, setting up of Cauvery River Management Board, crop
insurance for all farmers and remunerative prices for their produce.
</p>

<p>
On account of lack of water, for the last two years, Aandavar&rsquo;s
household has had to leave the land fallow after Navarai. In 2015, the
family produced 120 quintals of paddy in Navarai, out of which they kept
30 quintals for household consumption and sold the rest to Tamil Nadu
Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC) at Rs.1420 per quintal. Out of the
175 quintals of paddy straw produced, 105 quintals were earmarked for
animal fodder and the rest was sold locally at Rs.143 per quintal. On
the whole, Aandavar&rsquo;s household was able to earn a net income of about
Rs.1.25 lakhs from paddy cultivation that year.
</p>

<p>
The household also had 5 cows and 3 buffaloes, and the milk produced by
them was an important source of income during the lean seasons. However,
recurrent droughts made fodder scarce. As maintaining cattle became
uneconomical, and the household was unable to make its ends meet, they
were forced to sell their cattle.
</p>

<p>
Aandavar and his family are drowning in debt and last year&rsquo;s drought has
worsened their situation. In 2015, they mortgaged jewellery to a
cooperative society and took a loan of Rs. 1.35 lakh at 1 per cent per
month interest. This was on top of an agricultural loan of Rs.2.50 lakh
at 7% per annum given by the Tamil Nadu government in 2010. In 2017,
they took another loan of Rs.1.25 lakh to meet their consumption
expenses. They have already sold 2 acres of farmland in the last 7 years
to pay off the loans partially. With rising daily consumption expenses,
along with the education expenses of the 4 school-going children in the
family, loan repayment has become almost impossible.
</p>

<p>
Aandavar feared that he will have to sell all his land unless he got
some relief from the government. He added that irrigation will be
possible only if the Cauvery river water dispute is resolved with some
reasonable degree of water supply to downstream areas.
</p>

<p>
“If the government does not provide us with better crop prices and
effective crop insurance, many more farmers in my village may be forced
to commit suicide,” he said.
