&ldquo;The growth of gross domestic product in every sub-sector of the
Indian economy accelerated during the second half of the 2000s,
compared to the first half of the decade. However, employment growth
in most sectors except construction decelerated. This jobless growth
was partly the result of positive changes such as the reduction of
&rdquo;distress employment&ldquo; in agriculture, created during the previous
half-decade, and an expansion in the population of students. Rural
wages rose and average educational levels of the workforce improved.
Government interventions in rural India since the mid-2000s,
particularly the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee
Act, seemed to have aided these positive transformations. However,
manufacturing employment in the country fell and employment growth
slowed down in most constituents of the services sector. The new jobs
generated were predominantly in rural construction. The slow progress
in the diversification of India&rsquo;s employment structure has led to
large-scale withdrawal of women from the labour force, with the number
of women thus &rdquo;missing&ldquo; being as large as the population of Brazil.&rdquo;
