Jagdish Patel, a middle peasant with 11 acres of very fertile, irrigated land in the upper reaches of Narmada valley, is from Pachama village in Narsinghpur district of Madhya Pradesh. Narsinghpur is the largest sugarcane producing district of Madhya Pradesh and accounts for about 65 per cent of stateâ€™s production. Despite having 11 acres of very intensively cropped land, the income from all the crops amounted to only about Rs. 4,000 per capita per month. If we account for the value of large amount of labour done by four members of the family and value other households resources that were deployed on the land, the total income from 11 acres of their land was only about Rs. 48,000. This was barely 9 per cent of the total investment in production.

<p>
Jagdish Patel is a middle peasant with 11 acres of very fertile,
irrigated land in the upper reaches of Narmada valley. However, even for
his household, the return over investment, particularly when value of
their own labour and resources is accounted for, was very small.
</p>

<p>
Jagdish Patel is from Pachama village in the fertile Narsinghpur
district of Madhya Pradesh, situated in the upper part of the Narmada
Valley. Sugarcane is the major commercial crop of the region.
Narsinghpur is the largest sugarcane producing district of Madhya
Pradesh and accounts for about 65 per cent of state&rsquo;s production. There
are many sugar mills in the district. Kareli, a town in Narsinghpur, has
one of the largest <i>gur mandis</i> in India. But the farmers of the
district have been protesting for a long time for better produce prices.
In November 2017, sugarcane farmers staged a protest and burnt sugarcane
to show their anger.
</p>

<p>
Jagdish Patel (49 years) owns 11 acres of tubewell irrigated land which
is very intensively used. Last year, he had sugarcane on half of his
land. On the remaining land, he cultivated paddy in the kharif season
(June to November), followed by wheat in the rabi season (November to
March), and a third summer (March to May) crop of mung. Over the last
few years, new varieties of mung have become available that mature in a
little over two months. Use of tractors for land preparation and combine
harvesters for harvesting also helps in saving time. While tractors are
available for hiring locally, harvesting is done by combine harvesters
that come to Narsinghpur from Punjab during the harvesting season.
Availability of short-duration crops and mechanisation have made it
possible for farmers like Jagdish Patel to grow three crops in a year.
But growing sugarcane on half of the land, and paddy, wheat and mung on
the other half means that Jagdish Patel and his family have to work hard
in the fields round the year.
</p>

<p>
Sugarcane is an extremely cost and labour intensive crop. This is
particularly so in the year in which new setts (stalks or roots) are
planted. With high cost of seed material and land preparation, farmers
have to not only invest a lot of money but also have to labour very
hard. Sugarcane is also a difficult crop to maintain, as it needs
frequent irrigation, weeding and nutrient application. Weeding and
harvesting sugarcane is tough work as sharp sugarcane leaves often wound
workers.
</p>

<p>
Sugarcane is crop for which most farmers practice ratooning. That is,
once a freshly planted crop is harvested, the stubble is allowed to grow
into a new, ratoon crop. Although freshly planted sugarcane gives higher
yield, ratoon crops can give higher return because the farmer saves the
cost of land preparation, setts and planting. In view of this, most
sugarcane farmers take at least one or two ratoon crops of sugarcane
before they plant new setts again.
</p>

<p>
Last year, all the sugarcane on Jagdish Patel&rsquo;s land was freshly
planted. From this, he got 1000 quintals of cane which was sold for
Rs.240 per quintal to a sugar mill. He used DAP, urea, super phosphate,
potash, zinc and sulphur for the sugarcane crop, all of which together
cost him Rs. 74,000. In addition, he spent Rs. 55,000 on plant
protection chemicals. In comparison with a total paid out expenditure of
Rs 2.26 lakhs on sugarcane, Jagdish Patel got a net return of only about
Rs. 14,000.
</p>

<p>
The household got better returns from the other half of their land on
which they planted paddy, wheat and mung. In all, this land produced 100
quintals of paddy, 60 quintals of wheat and 15 quintals of mung. Annual
paid out expenditure on this part of the land, adding expenditure on all
the three crops, was about Rs. 1.5 lakhs. Over this paid out
expenditure, the household got an income of Rs. 1.8 lakhs.
</p>

<p>
It is noteworthy that, despite having 11 acres of very intensively
cropped land, the income from all the crops amounted to only about Rs.
4,000 per capita per month. If we account for the value of large amount
of labour done by four members of the family and value other households
resources that were deployed on the land, the total income from 11 acres
of their land was only about Rs. 48,000. This was barely 9 per cent of
the total investment in production.
