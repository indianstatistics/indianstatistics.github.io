<p>
This study deals with a new statistical domain, that of the village
(or gram) panchayat. This domain has emerged in rural India as a
consequence of the decentralisation programme initiated by the 73rd
Amendment to the Indian Constitution. The work of the Expert Committee
on Basic Statistics for Local-Level Development represents a landmark
in this regard because it sheds light on the potential of
village-level data sources for the new era of democratic
decentralisation in India. This paper examines data sources at the
gram panchayat level in relation to the needs that are generated if
the Constitution (73rd Amendment) Act, 1992 is implemented
comprehensively. From this point of view, the paper identifies three
categories of data needs. These are: data required for
self-governance, of which data required for managing the transition to
full-scope constitutional devolution are a special component (Data
Needs I and Ia); data required for matters of public finance (Data
Needs II); and data required for micro-level planning (and plan
implementation) for economic development and social justice (Data
Needs III).

The paper proposes that an essential constituent of village-level data
should be a list of individuals and families resident in the village
(a “People’s List”). The accuracy and quality of the various people’s
lists available with gram panchayats and other village-level agencies
are examined here, using data from independent surveys conducted by
the Foundation for Agrarian Studies in two villages.
