<p>
The NSSO/Labour Bureau series &ldquo;Wage Rates in Rural India&rdquo; is compiled
by the NSSO and the <a href="http://labourbureau.nic.in/main2.html">Labour Bureau, Shimla</a>. NSSO compiles these data
and publishes them in “Prices and Wages in Rural India (New
Series)”. Labour Bureau publishes the same data in the Indian Labour
Journal and separately in a publication called the &ldquo;Wage Rates in
Rural India&rdquo;.
