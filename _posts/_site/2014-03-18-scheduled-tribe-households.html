Broadly speaking, eight salient points emerge from the secondary data
on rural Adivasi households, which include various survey rounds of
the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) including the 66th
Round (2009–10), 68th Round (2011–12) and 69th Round (2012), the
Censuses of India, and other sources of official data.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Landlessness among rural Adivasi households is growing;
correspondingly, the number of Adivasi households that used to
cultivate some land has decreased. This indicates increasing
proletarianisation among significant sections of Adivasi
communities.
</li>
<li>Among rural Adivasi households, the proportion of households whose
primary occupation is wage labour is higher than the proportion of
households whose primary occupation is cultivation.
</li>
<li>The work participation rate among Adivasi women is higher than the
work participation rate among other social groups although the wages
of Adivasi women are lower.
</li>
<li>A relatively high proportion of Adivasi workers are short-term
migrants.
</li>
<li>There is acute deprivation with respect to living conditions in
Adivasi habitations and high levels of poverty among Adivasi
populations relative to other social groups.
</li>
<li>There is an increase in the number and proportion of Adivasi
people living in urban areas.
</li>
<li>There is an increase in the number of educated Adivasi youth.
</li>
<li>Accumulation, in the main, is taking place through the exploitation
of Adivasi land and labour by non-Adivasis; this process is driven
by policies of the state.
</li>
