"The working-age population of India is growing in size, the labour
force is shifting away from agriculture and, with higher education,
workers are also seeking better-quality non-agricultural jobs.
However, the trends between 2004-05 and 2011-12 indicate that
employment generation in the country has been inadequate to meet this
challenge. Construction has virtually become the only source of
incremental employment in rural India. In the urban areas, men have
been able to obtain a disproportionate share of high-productivity
employment."
