"This paper provides a documented account of what drove the post-1991
statistical policy shifts which contributed so much to what the Report
of the Committee on Unorganised Sector Statistics (2012) describes as
the "challenges" of ensuring the quality and credibility of India's
statistical database. The initial focus is on the ideology and actions
which lay behind the functionally destructive institutional
restructuring of two established Indian statistical organisations -
the Field Operations Division of the National Sample Survey
Organisation and the Economic Census. An account of the consequences
follows."
