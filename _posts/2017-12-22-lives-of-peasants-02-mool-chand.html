<p>
Moolchand (40) is a poor Kol peasant from Ginj, a village some 30 km
south-west of Allahabad, UP. The Kols are a tribe living on the UP-MP
border. Although recognised as ST in MP, they have bizarrely been
classified as SC in UP. The village lies in hilly terrain. It had a
population of 2246 as per 2011 Census. Government statistics for 2016
show that the village had an upper primary school, no health facility,
no post office and no bank. There is no public transport facility to the
village. There are no sellers of agricultural inputs in the village, no
cooperative society, no agricultural extension center, and no government
procurement centre.
</p>

<p>
Moolchand revealed the stark economics of loss and indebtedness, and the
family&rsquo;s desperate struggle to survive through harsh labour. He and his
wife Parvati live with their three daughters, one son and one
daughter-in-law. The eldest son Bhupendra is away in Mumbai for last
three years working in a restaurant.
</p>

<p>
His father had 0.85 acres of land. This was divided between Moolchand
and his two brothers, and Moolchand came to inherit only about 0.29
acres of land. Moolchand&rsquo;s land gets water from a canal, which allows
him to grow paddy in the kharif season and wheat in the rabi season.
</p>

<p>
Their tiny landholding yielded only 5 quintals of paddy and 1 quintal of
wheat last year. This is not even enough to fulfil their yearly
requirement of about 7 quintals of grain for sustenance.
</p>

<p>
So, Moolchand is left with no surplus to sell and cannot even save grain
for using as seed for the next sowing. Last year, he had to buy both
paddy and wheat seeds. They also had to buy small quantities of DAP and
urea in both the seasons. Details given by Moolchand showed that the
family spent Rs. 1585 for buying inputs for paddy and Rs. 1210 for
purchasing inputs for the wheat crop. The family barely recovered the
expenditure they had incurred in purchasing inputs.
</p>

<p>
All the cultivation work was done by the family itself with no hired
help. If one includes the value of their own labour and resources used
in the work, the family incurred a loss of Rs. 5025 in paddy crop and
Rs. 2560 in wheat crop.
</p>

<p>
Since agriculture gives them no surplus, how do they buy agricultural
inputs, food and other necessities for their family? Money for all this
and other incidental expenses comes from non-agricultural wage labour
done by Moolchand, Parvati and Bhupendra (in Mumbai).
</p>

<p>
Bhupendra gets food and a place to stay in the restaurant he works in,
and is therefore able to save and send about Rs. 5000 from his monthly
earnings to the family in Ginj. Moolchand and his wife quarry stones
from nearby hills to earn money. The contractor who employs them gives
them Rs. 3000 for quarrying 500 cubic feet of stones. This normally
requires 15 days of labour.
</p>

<p>
The family, however, is often short of money and they have to regularly
take advances from the stone contractor. Last year, because of
demonetisation, they were given old notes by the contractor throughout
the rabi season. An old Rs. 500 note was valued at Rs. 400 by input
dealers and shopkeepers from where Moolchand bought food and other
things for the family. In other words, Moolchand had to spend 20 per
cent more for all agricultural inputs and for consumption goods during
the rabi season last year because of demonetisation.
</p>

<p>
In May 2017, Moolchand and Parvati had to incur expenses for Bhupendra&rsquo;s
wedding. In addition to money saved from Bhupendra&rsquo;s earnings in Mumbai,
the family had to borrow from the stone contractor. Additionally, they
got Rs. 22,000 by mortgaging their agricultural land. Informal mortgages
in rural India are inevitably usufruct mortgages. Thus, in lieu of
interest, Moolchand has to let the lender use the land until Moolchand
is able to repay the loan.
</p>

<p>
This year, with the land mortgaged, they have nothing to cultivate. They
have had no access to credit from any bank. At the time of the survey,
the family had a debt of Rs. 28000.
</p>

<p>
“I hope that we will be able to repay this debt by quarrying stones and
using remittances sent by Bhupendra,” Moolchand said.
