<p>
This new report from UNDP &ldquo;revisits the theoretical concepts of
inequalities including their measurements, analyzes their global
trends, presents the policy makers&rsquo; perception of inequalities in 15
countries and identifies various policy options in combating this
major development challenge of our time.
</p>

<p>
The report makes the basic point that in spite of the impressive
progress humanity has made on many fronts over the decades, it still
remains deeply divided. In that context, it is intended to help
development actors, citizens, and policy makers contribute to global
dialogues and initiate conversations in their own countries about the
drivers and extent of inequalities, their impact, and the ways in
which they can be curbed.&ldquo;
